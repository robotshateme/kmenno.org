# Simple communion #

## Instructions ##

We will break the break together now, then eat our meal together. After the meal, we will share the cup together. If you decide to not participate in the Lord’s Supper, simply pass the elements to the person next to you. If you like, you may ask for a blessing by saying “Please bless me.” Parents should especially feel free to bless their children.


## The Invitation ##

All are invited to the Lord's table who have been baptized into the community of faith, are living at peace with God and with their brothers and sisters in the faith, and are willing to be accountable in their congregation.


## Prayer ##

Let us pray. 

Lord, bless this feast of remembrance, of communion and of hope. We ask that you bless the bread and the cup and our meal together. For the gifts you have given us, make us truly grateful. Amen.

## The bread ##

The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed, as he was were eating with his disciples, took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, “Take; eat; this is my body which is for you. I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer, for I tell you I shall not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” 

Break the bread and pass it.

After the bread is passed around: Jesus said, “Do this in remembrance of me.”

## Lunch grace, Enjoy the meal together ## 

## The cup ##

And likewise, after supper, he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, “This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”

Pour the wine and pass it. 

After the cup is passed around. Jesus said, “Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”

Let us pray the prayer our Lord taught us to pray, saying,

Our Father, who art in heaven,
Hallowed be thy Name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive those who trespass against us.
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.
For thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.
Amen.
