Listen to the words of the Mennonite Confession on the Lord's Supper.

> We believe that the Lord's Supper is a sign by which the church thankfully remembers the new covenant which Jesus established by his death. In this communion meal, the members of the church renew our covenant with God and with each other. As one body, we participate in the life of Jesus Christ given for the redemption of humankind. Thus we proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. 
>
> The Lord's Supper points to Jesus Christ, whose body was given for us and whose shed blood established the new covenant. In sharing the bread and cup, each believer remembers the death of Jesus and God's act of deliverance in raising Jesus from the dead. As we relive this event with a common meal, we give thanks for all God's acts of deliverance in the past and present, for the forgiveness of sins, and for God's continuing grace in our lives.
> 
> The supper re-presents the presence of the risen Christ in the church. As we partake of the communion of the bread and cup, the gathered body of believers shares in the body and blood of Christ and recognizes again that its life is sustained by Christ, the bread of life.
> Remembering how Jesus laid down his life for his friends, we his followers recommit ourselves to the way of the cross. Confessing our sins to one another and receiving forgiveness, we are to come as one body to the table of the Lord. There we renew our baptismal covenant with God and with each other and recognize our unity with all believers everywhere in all times.
> 
> Celebrating the Lord's Supper in this manner, the church looks forward in joy and hope to the feast of the redeemed with Christ in the age to come. 

All are invited to the Lord's table who have been baptized into the community of faith, are living at peace with God and with their brothers and sisters in the faith, and are willing to be accountable in their congregation.

We will break the break together now, then eat our meal together. After the meal, we will share the cup together. If you decide to not participate in the Lord's Supper, simply pass the elements to the person next to you. If you like, you may ask for a blessing by saying "Please bless me." Parents should especially feel free to bless their children.

I will take the bread, break it, and pass it to the next person. You please do the same. Please hold the bread; we will eat it together. As you pass the bread, feel free to say, "The Lord's body, broken for you."  Again, if you decide to not participate, simply pass the bread to the next person, and, if you choose, ask for a blessing. 

Let us pray. *Lord, bless this feast of remembrance, of communion and of hope. We ask that you bless the bread and the cup and our meal together. Make us truly grateful for the gifts you have given us. Amen.*

> The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed, as he was were eating with his disciples, took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to them, and said, "Take; eat; this is my body which is for you. I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer, for I tell you I shall not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God." 

*Break the bread and pass it.*

> Jesus said, "Do this in remembrance of me."

*Enjoy the meal together*

I will now take the "cup" and pour it, then pass it to the next person. You please do the same. Please retain your cup; we will drink it together. As you pass the cup, feel free to say, "The Lord's blood, poured out for you." Again, If you decide to not participate, simply pass the cup to the next person.

> And likewise, after supper, he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. And he said to them, "This is my blood of the new covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. Truly, I say to you, I shall not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."

*Pour the wine and pass it.*

> After the cup is passed around. Jesus said, "Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me."

Let us pray the prayer our Lord taught us to pray, [using the words “trespasses and trespassers”] saying,

> Our Father, who art in heaven,   
> Hallowed be thy Name.   
> Thy kingdom come.   
> Thy will be done,   
> On earth as it is in heaven.   
> Give us this day our daily bread.   
> And forgive us our trespasses,   
> As we forgive those who trespass against us.   
> And lead us not into temptation,   
> But deliver us from evil.   
> For thine is the kingdom,   
> and the power, and the glory,   
> for ever and ever.   
> Amen.
