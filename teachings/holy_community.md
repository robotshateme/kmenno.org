We worship the one holy and loving God who is Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit eternally.
God's awesome glory and enduring compassion are perfect in holy love.
To the one holy and ever-loving triune God be glory for ever and ever! 
God's Spirit was a source of power and revealed God's wisdom to prophets and other holy people. (Commentary) 
Other claims on our understanding of Christian faith and life, such as tradition, culture, experience, reason, and political powers, need to be tested and corrected by the light of Holy Scripture.
The church confesses and recognizes the authority of Holy Scripture (Commentary)          
They [the church]  are "a chosen race, a holy nation, God's own people" (1 Pet. 2:9; see Exod. 19:6). (Commentary)
Menno Simons mentioned the "priesthood of all believers" to encourage all believers, as "priests," to lead a holy life in order to be witnesses to the God who called them from darkness to light (1 Pet. 2:9). (Commentary)
As God's people, the church is a holy temple, [[2]][34] a spiritual house, [[3]][34] founded upon the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. (Commentary)   
Our faithfulness to Christ is lived out in the loving life and witness of the church community, which is to be a separated people, holy to God.
In the Old Testament, the seventh day was holy because it was the day God rested from the work of creation. [[5]][34] The Sabbath was also holy because of God's deliverance of the Hebrew people from slavery. [[6]][34] Through Jesus, all time is holy, set apart for God and intended to be used for salvation, healing, and justice. [[7]][34] In the present time, the church celebrates a day of holy rest, commonly the first day of the week, and is called to live according to Sabbath justice at all times.
We believe that the church is God's "holy nation," [[1]][34] called to give full allegiance to Christ its head and to witness to all nations about God's saving love. 
1. The language of the church as "holy nation" may be unfamiliar. Often, we have spiritualized the political language of the New Testament, forgetting that kingdom, Lord, and even the Greek word for church (literally, "assembly" or "town meeting") are political words. Political here refers to any structuring of group relationships. Understanding the church as nation can make clearer its relationship to the nations of the world.
