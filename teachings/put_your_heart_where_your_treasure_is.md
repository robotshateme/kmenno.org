= Put your treasure where your heart is =

Luke 12:2-34. 

> Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell your possessions, and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.


Last week, we discussed the previous section of Luke's gospel, which tells the story of the rich farmer. One of the questions I left you with was to consider what your spending patterns reveal about what you think is important to you. I'm wondering if you have any reflections about this this morning?

The US Government tracks how much people spend in different categories, and I spent some time looking at their data this week: yes, I know I'm that kind of person. Before taxes, the average "consumer unit" spent about $64,000 dollars in 2008. The biggest category was shelter: paying for the place where with live (about 20%). Transportation (cars, fuel, public transportation, etc.) is next, about 17%. Next is food: about 13%--about 40% of that for food outside the home). Apparently, Americans really want to have a roof over their home and want to be able to get around, and they want to eat, and often they want to eat conveniently. I was surprised that the next biggest category was money spent on life insurance, pensions and social security, about 11%. So, I guess we want to ensure we have money when we are older--of course, we are required to pay social security. Utilities eat another 7%; Healthcare and entertainment about 6% each (think about that!). We spend about 5% on clothes and grooming, and about 3 1/2 percent on "cash contributions," which include charitable giving, cash gifts and child support. The rest is spent on furniture, education, alcohol and tobacco, household goods and services and "miscellaneous." [1] None of these figures take into account the state and federal taxes we pay. I think we spend about $2,900 per person in the US for US national security; the average household is 2.5 people, so that's about $7,250 per household [3]. (Taxes are about $21,000 on average per person).

The Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University investigated giving patterns in the US as well [2]. Their report, from 2008, said that about 70% of US households gave at least $25 to charity, an average of about $2,200 dollars per giving household. GivingUSA Foundation estimates that about 35% of all giving was to religious causes [4].

So, the typical family in the US: wants a place to live, a car to drive, food for their belly, to be healthy and to be entertained, to have clothes and other physical goods and services. About 70% of US households think it's important to give some of their money away to other causes, and about 1 in 3 dollars they give away go to religious causes.

In the passage today, Jesus suggests a different way. I like they way Chris Zuraff, an intern pastor at Zion Lutheran Church of Amor in Minnesota, puts in his sermon from last week (thanks, Bing!):

>  Jesus goes on to say to the crowd a bit later, “For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” We often get this backward. We think Jesus says, “Put your treasure where your heart is.” But what he really says is that you put your treasure where you want your heart to go. If you put your treasure in bigger barns or in yourself, your heart no longer clings to God but it clings to your things.

The point is this, as I said last week: Jesus makes the reasonable suggestion that we spend our money on things which are really permanent: on people, on God's kingdom, on God and God's causes. Jesus isn't saying we shouldn't have shelter, food, clothing and transportation, or even entertainment. But what we spend our money on will affect our heart, and our heart will effect how we spend our money. 

As I think I said last week, we want to be known as giving and generous people, as a giving and generous church. Some of us express this by the occupations we pursue, and some by the way we spend our money. Some by the people we relate to, some by the time we spend on the projects to benefits others. And, of course, combinations of these. 

And I want to celebrate this fact, I want us to give an "Amen!" to the giving and generous choices we make. I want us to celebrate and support one another in this. Kudos! Thanks for the time and money you spend on really important things! And of course, there are many things that are not captured in the official statistics. 

And I want to continue to encourage you to think hard about how you, how we, spend our time and money, how we use our resources to become the people God wants us to be. In the coming year, how can we spend our time and money even _more_ wisely on becoming God's people?
