I’m still trying to understand grace, why it is that even though we are not ok, we are ok. That God, somehow, for some reason, doesn’t leave us alone, but works towards our good.

And we are taking the four weeks of Advent to explore grace. And I really have approached this without a lot of preconceptions of what the scriptures we are reading would tell us. Last week we reflected on how grace comes to us in expected ways. It’s almost part of the definition of grace, that we would receive it unexpectedly.

So, this week, we have John the Baptist.

Let’s be honest here. John is not about grace.

His first word: “Repent!”

This is how he described the people who came out to hear him: “a brood of vipers.”

It is _not_ ok, to be not ok. The ax is coming to cut down every tree that does not bear good fruit. He is filtering out the bad people. God is coming, and if you do not straighten up, if you are not prepared, God will cut you.

His program is a simple one. Flee from the world. Wear coarse, simple clothing. Eat low on the food chain. We don’t read it in the Scriptures, but from other sources, take a lot of cold baths. Oh, by the way, the plan seems to be for men only; sorry, ladies. I think you’re the reason for all those cold baths.

I suppose, from John, we can learn what grace is _not_:

1. Grace is not about living poor or living simply or living as an ascetic.
2. Grace is not about living in the city, or living in the country.
3. Grace is not insulting.
4. Grace is not threatening people with God’s punishment.
5. Grace is not even about repentance.

In all of the other passages in this morning’s readings, I see deep reflections of grace.

Isaiah has a vision of a shoot coming out of the stump of Jesse. That is, Isaiah sees beyond the failures of his current administration to a time when a descendant of King David, Jesse’s son. This king will institute a kingdom of grace, where:

- government itself, with all of its power, will be bent towards serving the poor and the meek,
- his reign will be one of peace, where even wolves and lambs can live together, and little children can play in the midst of wild animals
- ‘the earth will be full of the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea’

(Ok, I have got to admit: he also strikes the wicked dead.)

The psalmist, too, has a vision of a perfect king, who works towards the good of the poor and against their oppressors.

And Paul, writing in Romans, issues this supremely gracious command: “Welcome one another.” We are to be the peaceable kingdom that Isaiah saw. The things that divide us, especially ethnic divisions, are to dissolve away. For Paul, that was the divide between the Jews and Gentiles, but now Gentiles are to be included in God’s kingdom (thank you, Jesus).

That “welcome one another” is not a platitude. It’s not a “be nice to each other at church” thing. Think of the difficult people in your life; God invites you to welcome them (and them to welcome you). “Welcome one another” is a message of … grace.

We might even want to say to John that things have changed a bit since the coming of the one whom he promised!

1. We are to welcome those whose lives are in order, and those who lives are not.
2. We are to welcome those who are nearby and those who are far away.
3. We are to welcome others, which probably means not insulting them (even on Facebook)
4. We are to welcome others, and not threaten them.
5. We are to welcome one another _now_, not waiting until they get their act together.

In fact, I want to go back to John, and extract some more insight into grace, in perhaps an unexpected place (but, as we saw last week, that is where we expect to find grace: in unanticipated places). John looks forward to the coming of the one, “who is more powerful than I.” We know he is referring to Jesus.

Jesus will not come with a baptism of repeated cold baths, a baptism of water for repentance.

Jesus will come with Holy Spirit and fire.

First we remember that the next time Holy Spirit and fire are mentioned are at Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended on young and old, rich and poor, male and female.

But, second, we remember that John says that the fire with _burn up the chaff_. Now, on the face of it, this is no message of grace. But I want to claim that the fire of God that John refers to is not calling people “chaff”. In other words, the truth of his prophecy is not that God will _burning people up_ who are bad, but will be burning away all the chaff in our lives that harm us. Like last week’s thief in the night who comes to steal the junk we don’t need, this fire burns up anything not needed. The naturalists in our church can tell us how important fire often is for growth in the physical world.

I can’t recommend enough a story by Flannery O’Connor called _Revelation_. It’s the story of a 50s white middle-class Southern woman sitting in the waiting room of a doctor. I want to tell you the whole story, but I won’t. But I will tell you she has a vision of “a vast horde of souls were rumbling toward heaven.” Included in the vast horde are respectable people like herself, and “she could see by their shocked and altered faces that that even their virtues were being burned away.” It’s possible you can imagine what the virtues of a 50s white middle-class Southern woman are, and why even her virtues need to be burned away. This fire is also God’s grace.

So, what do we learn about grace this week?

- Grace burns away the chaff of our lives. It is ok that we are not ok because God will remove or convert all that “not-okness” of our lives.
- Grace is not a matter of doing the right thing, but of welcoming, of welcoming the right people, and welcoming the wrong people.
- Grace is receiving that welcome for ourselves when we feel like we deserve it, and especially when we feel like we don’t.

May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. (Romans 15:13)
