<p>Fifth in a series of teachings exploring the <a href="http://www.mennonitechurch.ca/about/cof/">Confession of Faith from a Mennonite Perspective</a>.</p>

<p>Will Fitzgerald, given at Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship, 2006-02-23</p>

<p>What do Mennonites think about creation? </p>

<p>Actually, there are several articles in the Confession that discuss creation one way or another, but this morning I want to focus on two articles: article 5 and 6, &#8220;Creation and Divine Providence&#8221;, and 
&#8220;The Creation and Calling of Human Beings.&#8221; We can see that these articles discuss creation in general in article five, and people specifically in article six. And if there is one word that describes a Mennonite view of creation, it is that creation is &#8230; good.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe that God has created the heavens and the earth and all that is in them, and that God preserves and renews what has been made. All creation ultimately has its source outside itself and belongs to the Creator. The world has been created good because God is good and provides all that is needed for life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>says Article 5. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe that God has created human beings in the divine image. God formed them from the dust of the earth and gave them a special dignity among all the works of creation. Human beings have been made for relationship with God, to live in peace with each other, and to take care of the rest of creation.
  We believe that human beings were created good, in the image of God.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>says Article 6.</p>

<p>In this, we listen to, and learn from the creation story in Genesis. You fill in the blanks:</p>

<ul>
<li>And God said, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; and there was light. God saw that the light was <em>good</em>.</li>
<li>God called the dry ground &#8220;land,&#8221; and the gathered waters he called &#8220;seas.&#8221; And God saw that it was <em>good</em>.</li>
<li>Then God said, &#8220;Let the land produce vegetation&#8221;&#8230;(and) the land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was <em>good</em>. </li>
<li>God set [the sun and the moom] in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth, to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was <em>good</em>.</li>
<li>So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was <em>good</em>.</li>
<li>God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was <em>good</em>.</li>
<li>So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them. &#8230; God saw all that he had made, and it was <em>very good</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, today, I want us to simply enjoy the goodness of God&#8217;s creation. </p>

<p>One way we can do this is in praising God for the creation. The writer of Psalm 148 does this in an interesting way. Let&#8217;s turn to this psalm together. As we read this, I want you to notice that the psalmist invites various creatures&#8212;that is, the creations of God&#8212;to join in praise. Let&#8217;s read this together.</p>

<h2 id="psalm148newrevisedstandardversion">Psalm 148, New Revised Standard Version </h2>

<p>Praise the Lord! <br />
Praise the Lord from the heavens; <br />
   praise him in the heights! <br />
Praise him, all his angels; <br />
   praise him, all his host!  </p>

<p>Praise him, sun and moon; <br />
   praise him, all you shining stars! <br />
Praise him, you highest heavens, <br />
   and you waters above the heavens!  </p>

<p>Let them praise the name of the Lord, <br />
   for he commanded and they were created. <br />
He established them for ever and ever; <br />
   he fixed their bounds, which cannot be passed.  </p>

<p>Praise the Lord from the earth, <br />
   you sea monsters and all deeps, <br />
fire and hail, snow and frost, <br />
   stormy wind fulfilling his command!  </p>

<p>Mountains and all hills, <br />
   fruit trees and all cedars! <br />
Wild animals and all cattle, <br />
   creeping things and flying birds!  </p>

<p>Kings of the earth and all peoples, <br />
   princes and all rulers of the earth! <br />
Young men and women alike, <br />
   old and young together!  </p>

<p>Let them praise the name of the Lord, <br />
   for his name alone is exalted; <br />
   his glory is above earth and heaven. <br />
He has raised up a horn for his people, <br />
   praise for all his faithful, <br />
   for the people of Israel who are close to him. <br />
Praise the Lord!  </p>

<p>[Short meditations on the sections of this psalm. Note who is praising God. Mention &#8220;dragons&#8221;]</p>

<p>William Billings was an early American composer, perhaps the first American composer. He wrote a lot of music that I like, including one piece called &#8220;An Anthem, for Thanksgiving.&#8221; The text is based on Psalm 148. I want us to listen to this and just enjoy it, and enjoy the creation he calls on to praise God. Be sure to listen for the dragons!</p>

<p>William Billings, An Anthem, for Thanksgiving <br />
Based on Psalm 148, with additions by Billings and Wentworth Dillon  </p>

<p>O praise the Lord of Heaven; <br />
praise Him in the Height, <br />
praise Him in the Depth; <br />
O praise the Lord of Heaven, <br />
praise Him all ye Angels, <br />
praise Jehovah.   </p>

<p>Praise Him Sun and Moon and blazing Comets, <br />
praise the Lord. <br />
Let them praise the Name of the Lord, <br />
For He spake the Word and all were made; <br />
He commanded and they were created; <br />
admire, adore.   </p>

<p>Ye Dragons whose contageous Breath, <br />
People the dark Abodes of Death, <br />
Change your dire Hissings into heavâ€™nly Songs, <br />
And praise your Maker with your forked Tongues.  </p>

<p>O praise the Lord of Heaven; <br />
Fire, Hail and Snow, Wind and Storms, <br />
Beasts and Cattle, creeping Insects, <br />
flying Fowl, <br />
Kings and Princes, Men and Angels, <br />
praise the Lord;  </p>

<p>Jew and Gentile, Male and Female, <br />
Bond and Free, <br />
Earth and Heaven, Land and Water, <br />
praise the Lord; <br />
young Men and Maids, <br />
old Men and Babes, <br />
praise the Lord.  </p>

<p>Join Creation, <br />
Preservation, <br />
and Redemption join in one; <br />
no Exemption, <br />
nor Dissention, <br />
one Invention, <br />
and Intention reigns through the Whole, <br />
to Praise the Lord.   </p>

<p>Hallelujah, praise the Lord. </p>

<h2 id="praisegodforcreation">Praise God for creation</h2>

<p>Now, I have a little task for you to help us all enjoy creation together. I&#8217;m going to pass out some paper, and I want you to write down some parts of creation <em>you</em> really enjoy, and invite those creatures to praise God. For example, if you&#8217;re really into dolphins and creatures like that, you might write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Praise him, dolphin and porpoises, <br />
   Manatees and sea lions,
   Otters and seals, 
   Whales and and all sea mammals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we&#8217;re done, I want to read the first and last parts of Psalm 148, and I want you to chime in with what you&#8217;ve written.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord! <br />
Praise the Lord from the heavens; <br />
   praise him in the heights! <br />
Praise him, all his angels; <br />
   praise him, all his host!  </p>

<p>[The invitation to all creation]</p>

<p>Hallelujah, praise the Lord!</p>
