[it was communion today, so in lieu of a sermon, I did this instead.]

Are you ready for a 22-point sermon?

First, notice that this list is "bookmarked" with love and goodness on
the one hand, and evil on the other. In verse 9: On the one hand,
"hate what is evil;" in verse 21: "Do not be overcome with evil."  One
the other hand: "let love be genuine ... hold fast to what is good,
love one another". In verse 21: "Overcome evil with good."

Second, that expression, "head burning coals on their heads." Let's
just agree that this won't be the major focus of what we look at
today. Paul's quote here is meant to encourage us to be kind to our
enemies and do them good. Maybe that will lead them to repentance or
to "kill them with kindness." Basically, I don't think anyone
understands the actual origins of this expression.

Third, these are the marks not of the true Christian, but the true
Christian *church*. The commands are given to "one another;" all of
the command verbs are plural. These are commands we are to obey
"jointly and severally," that is, we are each of us liable to obey
these commands, but we are also liable to obey them *as a church,* and
to help one another obey them.

Fourth, because we are jointly and severally to obey these commands,
let's look at them together. As I read the command, I would like you
to comment on:

* what the command means
* ways that you've seen your brothers and sisters follow this command
* ways you've seen what the *failure* to keep a particular command leads to
* what it means for you personally
* what it means for us as the Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship

Ok! Let's start.

1. Let love be genuine; Hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good;
2. Love one another with mutual affection;
3. Outdo one another in showing honor.
4. Do not lag in zeal,
5. Be ardent in spirit,
6. Serve the Lord.
7. Rejoice in hope,
8. Be patient in suffering,
9. Persevere in prayer.
10. Contribute to the needs of the saints;
11. Extend hospitality to strangers.
12. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.
13. Rejoice with those who rejoice,
14. Weep with those who weep.
15. Live in harmony with one another;
16. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly;​ [lowly things or
lowly people]
17. Do not claim to be wiser than you are.
18. Do not repay anyone evil for evil,
19. But take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.
20. If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
21. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of
God;​for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the
Lord.” No, “if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are
thirsty, give them something to drink; for by doing this you will heap
burning coals on their heads.”
22. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
