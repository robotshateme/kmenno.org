Luke 2:13,14  

   13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, 
   14       “Glory to God in the highest heaven, 
   and on earth peace among those whom he favors!”


The Holy Bible: New Revised Standard Version. (1989). (Lk 2:13–14). Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers.

## Introduction

During our four Sundays of Advent, we have been looking at, and trying to be caught up in, the great "canticles" or songs from the Christmas story as Luke presents it. These songs have been especially precious to the church over the centuries, and they all have their special names. Two weeks ago we looked at Mary's _Magnificat_, found in Luke 1:46-55. Last week, Michael took us through Zechariah's _Benedictus_ (1:67-79). This week, are join the angels in singing _Gloria in Excelsis Deo_ (2:13-14), and next week we'll listen to  Simeon's _Nunc Dimittis_ (2:28-32).

And so this week we look at the shortest song in the group, the Gloria. The angel of the Lord, perhaps Gabriel, who appeared to Mary, appears to a group of shepherds and announces the "good news of great joy which shall be unto all people." On that very day, the long-expected Messiah was born in humble circumstances; his majesty swaddled like any other baby; his crib a feed box, a temporary place of safety for an internally displaced child.

And then. And then. 

> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,  “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those whom he favors!”

Because this hymn is so short, we'll be able to dive deep into its meaning. Perhaps it will help us recover of the amazing meaning packed into it, which may have been worn off by great use.


## The form and structure

The first thing I notice in this short hymn is its structure. It's criss-crossed; the themes repeat, but are in different order; the themes repeat, but the specific themes change.

We start with "glory" given to "God" in "heaven".
The return is "on earth", "peace" to "favored humankind."

- Glory is paralleled to peace.
- God is in paralleled to humankind.
- Heaven is paralleled to earth.

It's Glory-Heaven-God, and then Earth-Peace-Humankind. Criss-cross. 

It's in this shape to make it more beautiful (and its beauty has been appreciated in many cultures and many languages). It's in this shape to alert us to the important people and ideas involved.

## Glory to God in heaven

Have you ever noticed that some words and expressions act out what they say. Let's start with some negative examples. If I say, "I feed you", just by saying those words, I'm not feeding you. I actually have to give you some food for this to be true. If I say, "I pick you up," I actually have to pick you up for this to be true.

But other words and expressions, just by saying them, act out what they say. For example, if I say, "I thank you," just by saying those words, I am thanking you! Or if I say, "I am disappointed in you," I express my disappointment.

"Glory" is one of these self-acting words, I think. When I say, "Glory to God!" I am not just hoping and wishing that God would receive glory. I am actually giving glory to God. And here, when the angels were praising God, when they said, "Glory to God" they were, by these words giving glory to God. 

The angels sing that the glory is given "in the highest," that is, in the metaphor that we live here on earth, and God and the angels live up there in heaven, this glory is expressed in the very tippy-top of the universe. 

But. Remember when the angel of the Lord first appears? The scripture says, 

> an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them.

And now there is a multitude of angels in glory. 

The picture I have in my mind is a great dome of light originating, "in the highest", surrounding the multitude of angels, and surrounding even further the shepherds. A great cone of glory, emanating from the place where God resides, and, in response, the angels and shepherds reflect this glory back to God.

This is the great turning point of the world. It is not at all surprising that the angels break out in praise.

## And on earth, peace to those whom God favors.

If the angels declare glory to God in heaven, peace is declared to those on earth. 

And I think it is a declaration. When there is a declaration of war, the war begins. When there is a declaration of peace, the war ends, and peace begins.

Remember that the angels are the messengers of God. They bring God's declaration.

When they shout, "Glory to God in heaven!" they are not so much speaking on behalf of God, as being overcome with delight, and they can but shout Glory. 

But here, they are declaring a state of peace.

Peace is given to everyone "whom God favors." Perhaps this is a deep theological point. That there are some people whom God does not favor, and peace is declared for some, whom God does favor.

But I don't think so. Rather, I think peace is the favor. Peace is declared for all who wish it – peace with God, peace with one another – and this blesses those able to take this gift.

And here's a little interesting bit of language. The Greek word for "glory" is "doxa." The Greek word here translated as "favor" is "eudokia". "Eu" means something is good. and "dokia" from "doxa" or glory. So, super literally, "well-glorified." It's another criss-cross. The hymn starts with glory, and ends with a glory word.

The favor we have of peace with God with glorious. 

We share the good glory of God. 

At that moment, in the deep of the night, the angels sing, and all is right with the world.

## Peace, peace, when there is no peace

But I can't help but remember, that when Jesus grows up he says this: 

> Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. The Holy Bible: New Revised Standard Version. (1989). (Mt 10:34). Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers."

And I remember Jeremiah's words:

>    They have treated the wound of my people carelessly, saying, “Peace, peace,” when there is no peace. The Holy Bible: New Revised Standard Version. (1989). (Je 6:14). Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers. 

And I look around. Some of us are wearing black because of the injustices that others have felt, or we have felt. 

We are aware of innocent children being beheaded because they are the wrong religion, and that some of them are children of our Christian sisters and brothers.

We are aware of girls being kidnapped. Boys being forced into warfare. 

We are aware of wars in fragile places, such as South Sudan.

We are aware of divisions and dissensions within the Christian body. We are aware of divisions and dissensions within our denomination, and even our conference; we can't agree on some really basic things.

We are aware of the burdens our leaders carry, such as Ervin Stutzman and Dan Miller.

## Where is the peace?

So, where is the peace? 

Listen to some words from the theologian NT Wright, quoted by David Jansen in the Intentional Christian Community Handbook, in which he describes the plan of Jesus, which is:

> rescuing people from the corruption and decay of the way the world currently is so they can enjoy, already in the present, the renewal of creation which is God's ultimate purpose – and so they can become partners in that large project.

This is the great turning point of the world. 

Peace is declared, but it is not yet fully extended outside of that dome of glory that surrounded the angels and the shepherds. 

We taste that peace. And we favored ones are asked to extend that peace. It's not exactly up to us, but we hare given the dignity of participation. 

And we long for and we look for that peace. 

Someday we will hear the words of Revelation 12:10:

>    Now have come the salvation and the power 
   and the kingdom of our God 
   and the authority of his Messiah


Someday we will hear the words of Revelation 11:15:

>    “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord 
   and of his Messiah,
   and he will reign forever and ever.” 


Someday we will hear the words of Revelation 19:1:

>    “Hallelujah! 
   Salvation and glory and power to our God, 


And the words of Revelation 19:6,7:

>    Hallelujah! 
   For the Lord our God 
   the Almighty reigns. 
   7       Let us rejoice and exult 
   and give him the glory, 
   for the marriage of the Lamb has come, 
   and his bride has made herself ready; 

Can I get a hallelujah? Can I get a glory to God?

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
