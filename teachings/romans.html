<ol>
    <li><a href="romans_overview.html">Romans, An Overview</a>
	<p>In which we do a quick overview of Romans, and think about the "deliberate ambiguity" inherent in the theological word <i>faith</i>.</p>
	</li>
    <li><a href="paul_and_homosexuality.html">Paul and Homosexuality</a> (Romans 1:18-31)
	<p>In which we examine whether the same-sex behavior Paul finds a sign
	  of the abandonment of God has anything to do with loving, life-long
	mutually chosen homosexual and lesbian relationships.</p>
	</li>
    <li><a href="being-unfaithful.html">Being Unfaithful</a> (Romans 2:1-3:21)
	<p>In which we examine again the idea of "faith" and "faithfulness,"
	and whether we can be faithful on our own.
	</p></li>
    <li><a href="the_mercy_seat.html">The Mercy Seat</a> (Romans 3:21-31)
	<p>
	In which we examine the good news of Jesus as "the representative of the whole
	human race." 
	</p></li>
    <li><a href="adam_abraham_jesus.html">Adam, Abraham and Jesus</a> (Romans 4,5)
	<p>
	In which we begin to trace the whole plot line of God's plan for humanity
	from our human origins, through Abraham and Israel, and through Jesus.	
	</p></li>
    <li>(Other teachers: Romans 6-7.)
    <li><a href="romans_8.html">Come, My Beloved</a> (Romans 8:1-4)
	<p>In which we spend a little time in the garden of delights of God's forgiveness and proclamation of rigtheouness.</p></li>
    <li><a href="romans_8_background.html">Body; Flesh; Spirit</a> (Romans 8:6-16)
	<p>In which we have a few sketchy outlined notes about the relationship
	 among body, flesh and spirit in Paul.</p>
	</li>
    <li><a href="working_together_towards_good.html">Working Together Towards Good</a> (Romans 8:18-39)
       <p>In which we see that God's plan is to bring us to Good, and everything 
	appears to collaborate towards this end.</p>
	</li>
    <li><a href="plan_b.html">Plan B?</a> (Romans 9-11)
	<p>In which we consider whether God's plan for us is God's "Plan B" in reaction
	 to our failures, or whether it was part of his plan all along.
		
	</p></li>
    <li><a href="true_israel.html">True Israel</a> (Romans 11)
	<p>In which we consider who is In and who is Out of the "True Israel."
	</p></li>
    <li><a href="transformed.html">Transformed</a> (Romans 12:1-2)</li>
    <li><a href="gifts_of_god_for_the_people_of_god.html">The Gifts of God For the People of God</a> (Romans 12:3-8)
	<p>In which we ask, in light of all this, is it reasonable to follow God? The answer will probably not surprise you.
	</p></li>
    <li><a href="marks_of_the_true_church.html">Marks of the True Christian Church</a> (Romans 12:9-21)
	<p>Simply a checkoff list, from Romans 12, of the marks of the true church. Useful for confession and self-correction.</p></li>
    <li><a href="church_and_state.html">Church and State</a> (Romans 13:1-7)
	<p>In which we discuss a notoriously difficult passage about the
	relationship between church and state.</p>
	</li>
    <li><a href="weak_together.html">Weak, Together</a> (Romans 13:8-15:7)
	<p>In which we consider how to deal with people who have very different ideas
	about what it means to be a Christian than us.
	 </p>
	</li>
    <li><a href="romans_summary.html">Romans, A Summary</a> (Romans 15:8-16:27)
	<p>In which we bring things to a conclusion, reviewing what we've seen.</p></li>
</p>

<p>It would be wrong for me to not mention the great debt I own to N.T. Wright, the current Anglican Bishop of Durham, England, whose work on Paul in general and Romans in particular have been extraordinarily useful in preparing these teachings.
