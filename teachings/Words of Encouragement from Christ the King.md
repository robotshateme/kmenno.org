It is Christ the King Sunday, the last week in the liturgical year. Christ is our King, but he comes on our behalf. There are many words of encouragement from this weekâ€™s lectionary passages. Here are some that I found. 


## From Ezekiel 34:11-16, 20-24 ##

1. God personally seeks us out, we who are his sheep.
2. God will personally rescue us from our places of scattering.
3. God will bring us into a land of delight.
4. God will give us the food and rest we need.
5. God will heal us when we are ill, and strengthen us when we are weak.
6. God will wreak justice on 'the fat and the strong,' whose strength is gained from unfairness.
7. God will provide the one shepherd, the true David.

## From Psalm 100 ##

1. God made us, and we are his people and sheep.
2. God is good, loves us, and remains faithful to us forever.

## From Ephesians 1:15-23 ##

1. God's immeasurable great power is exercised on our behalf.
2. God raised Jesus from the dead, and given Jesus all authority for ever (see Ezekiel!) over the world, and over the church.
3. God makes the church to be the body of Jesus, "the fullness of him who fills all in all."

## Matthew 25:31-46 ##

1. God will separate the sheep from the goats (the fat and lean sheep of Ezekiel's prophecy).
2. God deigns to work through us, to visit the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, the prisoner.
3. God deigns to visit us in the guise of the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick, the prisoner.
