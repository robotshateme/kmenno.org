> 36 One of the Pharisees asked Jesus​to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee’s house and took his place at the table. 37 And a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having learned that he was eating in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. 38 She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair. Then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment. 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him—that she is a sinner.” 40 Jesus spoke up and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” “Teacher,” he replied, “speak.” 41 “A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii,​and the other fifty. 42 When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?” 43 Simon answered, “I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.” And Jesus​l​ said to him, “You have judged rightly.” 44 Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. 45 You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. 47 Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little.” 48 Then he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” 49 But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” 50 And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.” 

Are you good or are you bad?

Jesus tells a story, and lives out a story, that overturns our understanding of being good and being bad.

We start with this understanding. 

Being a upstanding, scrupulous, religious person is good. Being a prostitute is bad.

Jesus goes to a good man's house to eat. Simon has all the signs of a good man: he is religiously scrupulous, he has made his way in the world, he is (I think) respected by his peers, and he practices hospitality. A bad woman--even Luke calls her 'a sinner'--comes in the house and breaks open the alabaster jar of oil, bathes Jesus's feet with it, and with her tears; she  dries Jesus feet with her hair. It is a very extravagant and impulsive and vaguely sexual act. Simon calls her "that kind of woman," and we know and feel his discomfort.  

Simon is good. The woman is bad.

And Jesus tells a story about two people whose debts have been forgiven. Let's say they went to a mutual friend of means to borrow some money. One needed enough money to buy a used car, the other enough to buy a decent house. They got the loan, and the both of them lost their jobs, and neither could pay. Which one, asks Jesus, feels more love for the lender? And Simon gives the obvious answer, which Jesus affirms: the one who was forgiven more.

Feeling love, and feeling gratitude is good. Both felt gratitude, but the one forgiven much loved much. 

And Simon, who (I think) treats Jesus as just another passing dignitary, treats Jesus in the normal way: gives him dinner, but doesn't go out of the way for Jesus. But this woman literally pours out her love for Jesus. And Jesus overturns our understanding: the woman shows more love than Simon does. So, we now understand this:

The woman is good. Simon is bad.

I think--I could be wrong--I think that this makes _us_ feel better. Probably, if we were to make a scale of what kind of people _should_ be regarded as good, we'd put prostitution way down low on the scale, and religious leaders high on the scale. And where would be put ourselves? Probably, we put ourselves somewhere in the large middle: we want to be a lot better than a prostitute, but not quite so good as a respected religious leader. Am I right? 

And if Jesus says the _woman_ is good, but _Simon_ is bad, we have got it made, right? We're not as "bad" as the woman, so we're better than good! We're not so self-righteous as Simon, so we're better than good! We don't see any need to change our attitudes towards ourselves or our behavior, because we seem to be in a safe middle: not so bad as a prostitute (who was good), not so falsely good as a Pharisee (who was really bad). 

The woman is good; we're better than the woman. Simon is bad; we're not as bad as Simon, so we're good. We are all warm and fuzzy in our goodness. Whew.

This is some twisted logic! This is some insane moral calculation!

Jesus, I am sure, did not come to make us feel good about our badness and bad about our goodness. 

So we probably need to come to a third understanding. Notice that Jesus doesn't actually say who is good and who is bad. Rather, here are the words his uses:

1. Forgiven
2. Saved
3. Faith
4. Peace

In Jesus's story in the story, the two men are forgiven their debts. The woman is declared forgiven. She is told her faith has saved her. She is told to go in peace.

The guests rightly ask, "Who is this that forgives sins?" and we know the answer--this is Jesus, the Son of God, who died for our salvation. He died, that we might be forgiven. He died, that we might be saved. He died, that we might have peace. Trusting in His love for us, having faith as the woman did, brings us forgiveness and salvation and peace.

Do you feel like the woman sometimes? Do you feel unclean and in distress, broken by life? Jesus stands ready to declare you forgiven and ready to give you peace.

Do you feel like Simon sometimes? Hard-hearted and self-righteous, your heart frozen? Jesus stands ready to declare you (even you) forgiven and ready to give you peace.

The woman is forgiven. Simon is forgiven. We can be forgiven.

Again, it would be twisted logic to think that (since we are forgiven) anything goes. Jesus tells a similar story to the one he tells here, about a man forgiven a really big debt, only to turn around and force one of _his_ minor debtors to pay up. Jesus doesn't forgive us just to leave us where we are. He wants us to "go in peace," not only feeling the assurance of our badness forgiven, but to live a life of peace. 

Ask these questions of yourself this week:

1. Do you believe that you can be forgiven?
2. Do you believe that Jesus brings forgiveness to you?
3. Do you desire to live a life of peace?

Ponder these answers:

1. I believe I can be forgiven.
2. I believe that Jesus brings forgiveness to me.
3. I desire to live a life of peace.
