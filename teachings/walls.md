# Walls #

The scriptures we have today have, as a kind of common theme, images of walls and other structures.

In the first scripture, from the first verses of Isaiah 5, is in the form of a lyric song. As I was preparing this teaching, I found John F. Hobbins's translation. Hobbins is a Old Testament scholar and a pastor who is especially interested in understanding and capturing the poetic structures of [ancient Hebrew poetry][1]

The singer's friend is the God who gardens. God prepares a vineyard in all the right ways, but the wine produced by the vineyard is not drinkable; it's sour; vinegar. And God's plan is to tear down the walls of the vineyard, to return it to wilderness and ravaging beasts. God's vineyard, of course, is God's people. The wine God expects is righteousness and order, but the sour wine God finds is murder and despair. The God who gardens is revealed as also the mighty God of many armies, powerful to destroy what needs destroying. I will just quickly note that our passage in Hebrews describes how, by faith, the Israelites saw the walls of their enemies at Jericho destroyed by this mighty God of many armies.

Our psalm is an interesting counter-point to Isaiah. This is a poem from the point of view of the "vine." It is in the midst of being destroyed, and it remembers, as did the singer in Isaiah, how God prepared the vineyard. The image is of a vine that started growing in Egypt, and grew and grew, snaking its way through the wilderness and into the fertile fields of Israel, where it prospered. 

But now, the wild things are attacking the vineyard--just as in Isaiah. Boars and fire and axe; the walls, too, are destroyed, letting in all these pests. The vine cries out to God; again, not so much the God who gardens, but the mighty God of many armies to protect and save the vineyard. And the vine promises to call on God's name if God does this for them. 

At first, I saw Isaiah and the psalmist as at odds, but it's just the point of view. Isaiah sees God's point of view: desiring and demanding right action of Israel. The psalmist see Israel's point of view: being attached from without by its enemies, and wondering where their God of protection is, and calling on God to protect them.

It's so interesting, therefore, to read Jesus's words in the light of these passages, written hundreds of years before he taught. He cries out,

>  "I came to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! I have a baptism with which to be baptized, and what stress I am under until it is completed! Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division! (Luke 12:49-51)

How can we read these passages without also thinking of Jesus's parable, found in the next chapter, of the fig tree in the vineyard:

> [Jesus] spoke this parable. "A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. He said to the vine dresser, ‘Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?’ He answered, ‘Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it, and fertilize it. If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.’" (Luke 13:6-9)

Jesus seems to be both _patient_ and _impatient_. Like the vineyard owner in both the parable and in Isaiah, he wants to see the results of God's kingdom come. But as the vine dresser recommends, and the "vine" in the psalm hopes, Jesus is patient, to allow a bit more time for the vineyard to produce, for the kingdom work to be done. 

Of course, we also understand that Jesus needed to undergo his own fire and baptism of death in order for this mercy to be extended to Israel and to all humankind. But, he warns us, this will not be a magic means to immediately bring in a peaceable kingdom. Rather, he warned that there would be many, many divisions in the kingdom. And, as a member of the Indiana-Michigan Conference of the Mennonite Church USA denomination of the Mennonite World Conference, from the Anabaptist tradition forged in European protest movements against the Roman Church, I'm here to testify that his predictive warning was, shall we say, correct.

Jesus's apostle, Paul, talked about walls and gardens and buildings and he talked about fire, too, in a passage that resonated strongly with Menno Simons. Paul writes, in 1 Corinthians 3, in a passage that is directly about the divisions he saw beginning in the church:

> You are God’s field, God’s building. By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one should be careful how he builds. For no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ. If any man builds on this foundation using gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay or straw, his work will be shown for what it is, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man's work. If what he has built survives, he will receive his reward. If it is burned up, he will suffer loss; he himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames. Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him; for God's temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:9c-17).

Again, Paul reminds us both of God's gardening spirit and God's mighty power. God desires to build a building with beautiful walls, built with costly materials--the work of _our_ own hands, built on the incomparable foundation of Jesus Christ. Some day, the fire Jesus promises will come in its fullness, and Paul makes this sound, if not pleasant, at least salutatory. It will burn away all the dross, the bad wood. Like a forest fire renewing a pine forest, God's refining fire is part of God's spiritual ecology.

Where does this leave us? There is the image of the God who gardens and builds, who, with great patience and earnestness, is growing a people the way a gardener grows a vine or a builder builds a building. There is the image of the mighty God of many armies, and a God of fire who overthrows and burns up all imperfection with fully righteous power.  

Are we more comfortable with the gardening God? Perhaps. But the God who gardens is also revealed as the mighty God of many armies. Paul writes that Jesus "is our peace, in his flesh he has mad both groups [that is, both Jews and non-Jews] into one and broken down the dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us." It's useful to remember that it takes great power and perhaps more than a little pain to tear down a wall. The image of "breaking down walls" is an image of the mighty God; we need God's power, God's fire to achieve the peace and reconciliation. Jesus's baptism of fire, his death and resurrection, was an act of power.  

So, this week let us keep in mind these images of our God, who destroys and builds up, who nurtures and burns, who brings us through peace and through pain.
