Irony of the King


- Double meaning "It's such a warm and beatiful day today"
  - One is the normal meaning of an expression 
  - The other is 'the opposite' meaning
- Two audiences 
  - One the 'naive' listener
  - The other is 'in on the joke'

Luke 23:33-43
23:33 When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.

- the "Skull"
- the unmarked "they"
  - the soldiers? the 'people'? the 'powers'?
- the criminals

23:34 Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing." And they cast lots to divide his clothing.

- there is that 'they' again
- one of the 'theys' -- the soldiers, who are just doing their jobs
  - part of their job means the get the spoils of war
  - this is the normal and natural behavior of those who oppress others
  - they are acting on behalf of others
- this is all common and all too 'plain' in meetings
  - For example, this story from the Congo (don't read if kids are present):
	Civilians are slowly coming back to towns and villages like Kibumba, 17 miles north of Goma, which was liberated on 26 October from M23. They walk through destroyed villages, some carrying rolled mattresses on their heads. Several houses are occupied by soldiers of the regular Congolese army.

	But few women and girls have dared to return. Many who had survived mass rapes were later driven out of their villages by militias after being pushed into exploitative work. Some were forced by rebels to toil in mines in conditions of slavery to produce the gold, coltan and tin needed to make jewellery, mobile phones and laptops, a Guardian investigation in 2011 discovered.

	Yet at the market in Kibumba, a sense of relief prevails. Many young men are back at work, some selling onions, avocados and piles of fresh cabbage. "I am proud of my army today," says 22-year-old Niyonzima Byirenge. "We have suffered for too long with the rebels. We had to pay taxes for everything: transport, kids, houses and even going to the market. Just sending a truck to Goma was a matter of $400. They took 10% of our goods on each market day, twice a week. Those who disagreed were beaten up and sent to the central prison of Rutshuru."

	Maman Divine, 25, the wife of a local smallhold farmer, is delighted at the mere fact that soldiers pay her for her goods, small bags of sugar, peanuts and palm oil. "We had to do everything for the rebels, she says. Bring wood, water and meals. They took our best clothes. Sometimes, they came to our houses at night, they told the man to go out and raped his wife.

23:35 And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, "He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!"

- here is another they: the people
- and other: their leaders
- first irony
  - the first audience - Jesus, 
  - the second audience - the crowds and the Romans and Jesus

23:36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine,

23:37 and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"

- back to the solders
  - second irony

23:38 There was also an inscription over him, "This is the King of the Jews."

- third irony
- Who put this up?
  - The 'powers'
    - really, this was not irony; this is the crime they charged him with
- Luke put this up!
  - Iron
    - First audience — the Romans, the people, the leaders of our imagination
	- Second audience - us, we are to believe 

23:39 One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, "Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!"

- Fourth irony
  - first audience, Jesus
  - second audience -- himself, Jesus, and the 2nd thief
  - Even his fellow thief derides him

23:40 But the other rebuked him, saying, "Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?

23:41 And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong."

- 2nd thief removes the irony

23:42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom."

- Some think that he is being gently ironic here 
  - first audience is Jesus and himself
  - 2nd audience is himself; he thinks he is merely providing comfort to a 
    failed revolution
- Others think this is a statement of faith and hope -
  - doesn't understand what this kingdom could be, but wants to be part of it

23:43 He replied, "Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise."

- Jesus removes all the irony
  - "Paradise" — the place where the righteous dead go 
  - Jesus opens the way to Paradise
  - Jesus is the way to Paradise
  
Christ the King -
  - A first irony: 
    - Jesus has no interest in being a human king
  - A second irony:
    - Jesus achieves his reign through servanthood
  - A third irony:
    - Jesus is actually more than a king
	- The Colossians pasage:
Colossians 1:13-20

He has rescued us from the power of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or powers--all things have been created through him and for him. He himself is before all things, and in him all things hold together. He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything. For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell, and through him God was pleased to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, by making peace through the blood of his cross.
