Trinity Sunday

According to the church calendar, today is Trinity Sunday. The New Advent encyclopedia says the church has been celebrating this at some point and in some places since the fifth century, and was declared a feast day celebration for the Trinity on the first Sunday after Pentecost in the 14th century. 

When I was a student at college, I asked our pastor, who was never shy about preaching and teaching deep theological truths, if he would preach a sermon on the Trinity for Trinity Sunday. As I remember it, he just laughed. I'm still not sure why. 

But perhaps it is because the Trinity is one of those doctrines which, if you talk about it too much, just turns people off. It seems difficult to relate getting the relationships between the persons of the Trinity correct to our daily lives. As practical Americans, we tend to ask, "What is in it for me?" And the Trinity isn't about us primarily, of course, but about God's nature. At best, if we talk about it just right, it won't seem ridiculous, and people won't be turned off. 

However, I'm not quite sure this is the case, and I want to risk talking about the Trinity this morning. I hope it will make a small difference in our lives, and I hope it will help us to love and adore God a bit more. After all, if the chief end of humanity is to glorify God, and to enjoy God forever, it would be a good idea for us to learn as much as we can about God. This was a major reason Christians spent centuries trying to think through a proper understanding of God's nature.

There is a poem by James Weldon Johnson that starts out:

> And God stepped out on space,   
> And he looked around and said:  
> I'm lonely -  
> I'll make me a world.   

And after God makes the world, God is still lonely, so:

> Then God walked around,    
> And God looked around  
> On all that he had made.  
> He looked at his sun,  
> And he looked at his moon,   
> And he looked at his little stars;  
> He looked on his world  
> With all its living things,  
> And God said: I'm lonely still.   
>   
> Then God sat down --   
> On the side of a hill where he could think;  
> By a deep, wide river he sat down;  
> With his head in his hands,  
> God thought and thought,  
> Till he thought: I'll make me a man!  

Well, there are two things that this poem gets very right in this poem, and there's something that's very, very wrong. 

Here's what the poem gets right is this: 

First, God is a creating God; God loves to bring things into being. It is God who lit the firecracker we call the Big Bang, and bring everything we can see and we can not see into being.
  
Second, God is a relational God. God longs to be in relationship with the creation, with humanity. God isn't an abstract point; God didn't just light the firecracker we call the Big Bang and then step out of relationship to us. As John writes, God loves the world. As the author of Hebrews says, God "uphold[s] all things by the word of his power," and thus continues both to create and to relate to the creation.

But what this poem gets very, very wrong is to think that God would be lonely without us, or unable to be a creator without the creation. God loves to be in relationship, but he doesn't need us to be in relationship. God loves to create, but God is not incomplete without the creation.

The doctrine of the Trinity, in short says something like this: God exists as three persons (whom we call the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit), but has one nature. Frank Sheed, the Catholic writer, helped me to understand this better, but Sheed learned his lessons well from Augustine.

First, we start with God the Father. God the Father is perfect, and God the Father perfectly knows himself. 

Second, this act of knowing produces a perfect Idea, for God the Father is perfect. This Idea is a Word; this Idea is _the_ Word. God the Father's perfect knowing brings forth the Perfect Word, God the Son. This might be described as an act of creation, but it is an act of eternal and perfect creation; God this Son is not _made_ like the world is made. The theological word used to described this is _begotten_, as long as we remember we are not talking about physical begetting, but the eternal, perfect Word being brought forth.

Third, God the Father beholds God the Son, and loves the Son with perfect love. God the Son does the same to God the Father. As the Word is brought forth by the creative Mind of the Father, so the perfect relationship of Love between God the Father and God the Son brings forth God the Spirit. 

As the Athanasian Creed has it:

> The Father was neither made nor created nor begotten; the Son was neither made nor created, but was alone begotten of the Father; the Spirit was neither made nor created, but is proceeding from the Father and the Son.  

I say, "first, second, third," but we must remember that with the eternal God there is no before and after. God the Father didn't exist before God the Son as God exists before the creation of the world. Nor do the Father and the Son exist before the Holy Spirit; they are all of one eternal nature, and the begetting and the proceeding take place in eternity, "as is now, and was, and is to come." 

So, the persons of the Godhead are distinct persons, but they have the same nature. It's not God playing three roles, or God revealing God's self in three ways; it is especially not Three Gods. It's hard to understand, and it's no wonder many modern Christians don't think about it much, and Muslims and Jews think we're a bit silly.  

JBS Haldane, a scientist of the last century once said this, "Now my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose." Sometimes this is paraphrased as, "The universe is not only stranger than we imagine, but stranger than we can imagine." Our tiny, finite minds have a hard time wrapping itself around all the wonders of the universe. How much more will this be true of the infinite God, who created the heavens and the earth? 

## Call to Action ##

We are created in the image of God, and we can, in finite but meaningful ways, bear the image of the God. 

- How is God calling you to love this week?
- What is God calling you to create this week?
- What is God calling you to know this week?
- How can you love and adore God this week?
 

## The Athanasian Creed ##

Whoever wants to be saved should above all cling to the catholic faith.

Whoever does not guard it whole and inviolable will doubtless perish eternally.

Now this is the catholic faith: We worship one God in trinity and the Trinity in unity, neither confusing the persons nor dividing the divine being.

For the Father is one person, the Son is another, and the Spirit is still another.

But the deity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one, equal in glory, coeternal in majesty.

What the Father is, the Son is, and so is the Holy Spirit.

Uncreated is the Father; uncreated is the Son; uncreated is the Spirit.

The Father is infinite; the Son is infinite; the Holy Spirit is infinite.

Eternal is the Father; eternal is the Son; eternal is the Spirit: And yet there are not three eternal beings, but one who is eternal; as there are not three uncreated and unlimited beings, but one who is uncreated and unlimited.

Almighty is the Father; almighty is the Son; almighty is the Spirit: And yet there are not three almighty beings, but one who is almighty.

Thus the Father is God; the Son is God; the Holy Spirit is God: And yet there are not three gods, but one God.

Thus the Father is Lord; the Son is Lord; the Holy Spirit is Lord: And yet there are not three lords, but one Lord.

As Christian truth compels us to acknowledge each distinct person as God and Lord, so catholic religion forbids us to say that there are three gods or lords.

The Father was neither made nor created nor begotten; the Son was neither made nor created, but was alone begotten of the Father; the Spirit was neither made nor created, but is proceeding from the Father and the Son.

Thus there is one Father, not three fathers; one Son, not three sons; one Holy Spirit, not three spirits.

And in this Trinity, no one is before or after, greater or less than the other; but all three persons are in themselves, coeternal and coequal; and so we must worship the Trinity in unity and the one God in three persons.

Whoever wants to be saved should think thus about the Trinity.

It is necessary for eternal salvation that one also faithfully believe that our Lord Jesus Christ became flesh.

For this is the true faith that we believe and confess: That our Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son, is both God and man.

He is God, begotten before all worlds from the being of the Father, and he is man, born in the world from the being of his mother -- existing fully as God, and fully as man with a rational soul and a human body; equal to the Father in divinity, subordinate to the Father in humanity.

Although he is God and man, he is not divided, but is one Christ.

He is united because God has taken humanity into himself; he does not transform deity into humanity.

He is completely one in the unity of his person, without confusing his natures.

For as the rational soul and body are one person, so the one Christ is God and man.

He suffered death for our salvation. He descended into hell and rose again from the dead.

He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

At his coming all people shall rise bodily to give an account of their own deeds.

Those who have done good will enter eternal life, those who have done evil will enter eternal fire.

This is the catholic faith.

One cannot be saved without believing this firmly and faithfully.

## Appendix: A Quote from Frank Sheed ##

Sheed:

> "The First Person knows Himself; His act of knowing Himself produces and Idea, a Word; and this Idea, this Word, is the Second Person.  The First Person and the Second combine in an act of love - love of one another, love of the glory of the Godhead which is their own; and just as the act of knowing produces an Idea within the Divine Nature, the act of loving produces a state of Lovingness within the Divine Nature.  Into this Lovingness, Father and Son pour all that They have and all that They are, with no diminution, nothing held back.  Thus this Lovingness within the Godhead is utterly equal to the Father and the Son, for They have poured Their all into it.  There is nothing They have which their Lovingness does not have.  Thus Their Lovingness too is Infinite, Eternal, Living, Someone, a Person, God.  Observe that here again we are still within the Divine Nature.  For love is wholly within the nature of the lover.  But this love wholly contains the Divine Nature, for God puts the whole of Himself into love."
