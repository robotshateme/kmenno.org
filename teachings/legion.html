<p>[On third Sundays, it is our tradition to hear someone&#8217;s spiritual journey so far. Jason Byler couldn&#8217;t do his faith journey story today, so I&#8217;m telling the gospel lesson as such a story]</p>

<p>I am glad that you all invited me to talk to you this morning. My thanks. Most people just call me &#8220;Legion,&#8221; and I want to tell you how I got that name.</p>

<p>You probably couldn&#8217;t tell from looking at me now, but I used to be crazy. And when I say &#8220;crazy,&#8221; I mean the kind of crazy person you <em>should</em> be scared of. I even scared the other crazy people. </p>

<p>Where&#8217;s the worst place you can imagine living? I&#8217;ve known people who lived in city parks, under bridges, and who squatted in empty buildings. Me, I lived in a cemetery. My only company was with dead bodies. I didn&#8217;t really <em>want</em> to live in a cemetery, but it was a place where I could be away from people.</p>

<p>Cause I was crazy, as I think I mentioned, and crazy strong. I grew up in the city, in the Decapolis, and people would literally bind me up with locks and chains, and I would get out of them. They kept me under guard when they locked me up, but I would break loose and run out into any wild place I could find. </p>

<p>It was real quiet in the cemetery; real quiet, except for me. I would howl and scream in the night and in the day. Cause <em>they</em> were inside me, the voices, hundreds of voices, thousands of voices. Sometimes they would tell me what a terrible person I was. Sometimes they would tell me to hurt myself. And I would decide that I needed to stone myself, so I would take the biggest rocks I could pick up and throw them at myself. Or I throw them into the air, and let them hit me. One of the voices suggested that I throw myself on the stones instead of throw the stones at myself. I was a mess of bruises and cuts and contusions. </p>

<p>And here&#8217;s another thing: some of the voices told me to tear off all my clothes, because I was unfit to wear clothes like a normal person, and I should be ashamed of all my sin. So, I was naked a lot of the time.</p>

<p>So, except for the voices inside my head, I didn&#8217;t have much company. Well, there was a big, noisy pig herd in a nearby field. For some reason, not many people wanted to have lunch with a naked, crazy person with the strength of two men, who lived among the tombs. And a bunch of pigs.</p>

<p>But one day, this man arrived and changed my life. I was pretty confused at the time, so the exact sequence of events is a bit fuzzy. I was howling and screaming and throwing stones at myself as usual. And when I saw Jesus coming towards me, the voices started up. And they kind of took over my voice box, and I heard myself screaming at him, &#8220;What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torture me&#8221; And this <em>was</em> Jesus, but you know, I didn&#8217;t know that at the time. But those voices knew who he was. And they screamed a few more other things that would be ashamed to repeat.                 </p>

<p>And they threw me at his feet, and I lying there, looking up at him.</p>

<p>But then, I remember that he asked me what my name was. And that kind of stopped me for a minute, because I knew that your name was something you were supposed to remember, and I couldn&#8217;t remember it. But then I thought of all my voices, and I told him that my name was &#8220;Legion,&#8221; like a Roman legion, you know? Only I didn&#8217;t really fell like I was in charge of the legion, but the legion was in charge of me.</p>

<p>And I remember how strange it was to be having something like a normal conversation with someone. But then it was like Jesus was in command of the voices. I could tell, I think, that they thought they were trouble, and my head kept jerking back and forth, looking at Jesus, and looking at those pigs, and then looking at Jesus again. </p>

<p>And then I heard them kind of growling, &#8220;You&#8217;re going to destroy us, aren&#8217;t you? You&#8217;re going to send us back into the sea and the abyss?&#8221; (By the way, this was the first time I ever thought there was a worse place to be than inside me.)  And then they said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that&#8212;could you send us into those pigs instead?&#8221; Pigs, you know, aren&#8217;t that popular with Jews like Jesus, and I think they thought they could kind of trick him. And just like that, Jesus ordered my legion out of me, and somehow they marched over to that herd of pigs, and went inside the pigs instead of me, and then those pigs starting running. The ran down the steep bank, and I hear those pigs didn&#8217;t stop running until they got to the big lake, the Sea of Galilee, and then they drowned themselves. So, you see, Jesus won <em>that</em> argument. They ended up in the abyss anyway. It&#8217;s kind of funny, when you think of it.</p>

<p>Of course, the people taking care of the pigs were a bit upset&#8212;and afraid, I think. They ran off, too, chasing those pigs, but then they went into the city. And then it <em>was</em> really quiet: just Jesus, and me. He took care of me. He got some extra clothes that he had. He told me that if someone had two pairs of clothes, and they met someone who didn&#8217;t have any clothes, they really should share and cleaned me up a bit. I just sat there, and I had never felt so peaceful, just listening to his voice, and the quiet sounds of the field (no pigs grunting or my voices screaming). He didn&#8217;t have much time, but what he told me in the time we had together: that I was loved by his Father, who was bringing a kingdom that was breaking into the world, and that those who were oppressed could be free&#8212;not free like I was free to be a crazy man in the tombs, but free to live a life of love for myself, for others and for God. And he sang me this song:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Come, humble sinner, in whose breast <br>
  A thousand thoughts revolve, <br>
  Come, with your guilt and fear oppressed, <br>
  And make this last resolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I found myself singing back:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ll go to Jesus, though my sin <br>
  Hath like a mountain rose; <br>
  I know His courts, I’ll enter in, <br>
  Whatever may oppose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We just sat a while. </p>

<p>And then the people from the town came to the graveyard. And it wasn&#8217;t quiet any more. It was odd, because I had, of course, seen lots of fear in their eyes before. But somehow, my sitting there, dressed and in my right mind, made them even more afraid than usual. Of course, it might have just been the thing with the pigs, but I think they were afraid of what kind of change Jesus might ask of them. They were used to the normal chaos I brought them; they weren&#8217;t ready to give that up and maybe see even bigger changes. I don&#8217;t know. But they &#8220;asked&#8221; Jesus to go away, in that kind of aggressive way some people have of being polite. He said that foxes had holes, and birds had nests, but that the Son of Man had no place to lay his head (I at least had my graveyard), and that he had to announce the Kingdom of God to all Israel, so he started to leave.</p>

<p>I walked with him for a while, and I asked him to allow me to come with him, that I wanted to become his student. But he looked at me, bruised and broken by my many self-attacks, and told me to return to the Decapolis, where I still had people, and to heal up&#8212;and, most importantly, to proclaim how much God had done for me.</p>

<p>Every day, I get up and thank God that I woke up in my right mind. Every day, I get up and thank God for the clothes on my back. Every day, I get up and try to tell at least one person what God had done through Jesus for me. Sometimes, I can hear the echoes of those voices, and rather than frighten me, they remind to be kind to others in their many difficulties, especially those who hear voices, too. </p>

<p>Thank you for having me this morning. What has God done for you this week? And, this week, to whom can you speak the peace of God?</p>
