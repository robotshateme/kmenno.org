Christ the King

End of church year; next week in the first week in the new church year, first week in Advent. Celebrated as "Christ the King." 


Christ as King

A King has a Kingdom

Jesus declares at the beginning of his ministry "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near;​repent, and believe in the good news."  [Mark 1:14]

The Kingdom is where the citizens are

Luke 17:20-21 Once Jesus​was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, and he answered, “The kingdom of God is not coming with things that can be observed; 21 nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’ For, in fact, the kingdom of God is among​you.” 


Kings have power
