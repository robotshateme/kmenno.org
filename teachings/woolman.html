His grandfather was one of the early Quakers who came to the American colonies, settling in the colony of New Jersey. Woolman was born in 1772 to a fairly prosperous farm family, and died in 1772, of smallpox, while on a preaching visit to England. I want to read passages from Woolman’s Journal that given an insight into his life and devotion to following Christ.</p>		<h2 id="early_life">Early life</h2>		<p>Here’s how he describes his very early life:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>I was born in Northampton, in Burlington County, West Jersey, in the year 1720. Before I was seven years old I began to be acquainted with the operations of divine love. Through the care of my parents, I was taught to read nearly as soon as I was capable of it; and as I went from school one day, I remember that while my companions were playing by the way, I went forward out of sight, and sitting down, I read the twenty-second chapter of Revelation: “He showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,” etc. In reading it, my mind was drawn to seek after that pure habitation which I then believed God had prepared for His servants. The place where I sat, and the sweetness that attended my mind, remain fresh in my memory.</p>		</blockquote>		<p>But sometimes he was naughty. When he was a child, he threw stones at a mother robin and killed it.</p>		<blockquote>			<p>At first I was pleased with the exploit, but after a few minutes was seized with horror, at having, in a sportive way, killed an innocent creature while she was careful for her young. I beheld her lying dead, and thought those young ones, for which she was so careful, must now perish for want of their dam to nourish them. After some painful considerations on the subject, I climbed up the tree, took all the young birds, and killed them, supposing that better than to leave them to pine away and die miserably. In this case I believed that Scripture proverb was fulfilled, “The tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.” I then went on my errand, and for some hours could think of little else but the cruelties I had committed, and was much troubled.</p>		</blockquote>		<p>He seems to have had his ‘wild oats’ years. He wasn’t sure, I think, whether this God thing was for him, and he went back and forth many times.</p>		<blockquote>			<p>I was not so hardy as to commit things scandalous, but to exceed in vanity and to promote mirth was my chief study. Still I retained a love and esteem for pious people, and their company brought an awe upon me. My dear parents several times admonished me in the fear of the Lord, and their admonition entered into my heart and had a good effect for a season; but not getting deep enough to pray rightly, the tempter, when he came, found entrance. Once having spent a part of the day in wantonness, when I went to bed at night there lay in a window near my bed a Bible, which I opened, and first cast my eye on the text, “We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us.” This I knew to be my case, and meeting with so unexpected a reproof I was somewhat affected with it, and went to bed under remorse of conscience, which I soon cast off again.</p>			<p>Thus time passed on; my heart was replenished with mirth and wantonness, while pleasing scenes of vanity were presented to my imagination, till I attained the age of eighteen years, near which time I felt the judgments of God in my soul, like a consuming fire, and looking over my past life the prospect was moving.</p>		</blockquote>		<h2 id="business_and_slavery">Business and slavery</h2>		<p>Eventually, he was apprenticed to (I guess we’d say, ‘did an internship with’) a local businessman, a “shopkeeper and baker,” where he tended the shop and keep the accounts. Eventually, he also learned to be a tailor. Remember, this was very early in our history, and although he lived in the colony of New Jersey, slavery was perfectly legal.</p>		<blockquote>			<p>My employer, having a negro woman, sold her, and desired me to write a bill of sale, the man being waiting who bought her. The thing was sudden; and though I felt uneasy at the thoughts of writing an instrument of slavery for one of my fellow-creatures, yet I remembered that I was hired by the year, that it was my master who directed me to do it, and that it was an elderly man, a member of our Society, who bought her; so through weakness I gave way, and wrote it; but at the executing of it I was so afflicted in my mind, that I said before my master and the Friend that I believed slave-keeping to be a practice inconsistent with the Christian religion. This in some degree abated my uneasiness; yet, as often as I reflected seriously upon it, I thought I should have been clearer if I had desired to be excused from it, as a thing against my conscience; for such it was. Some time after this a young man of our Society spoke to me to write a conveyance of a slave to him, he having lately taken a negro into his house. I told him I was not easy to write it; for though many of our meeting and in other places kept slaves, I still believed the practice was not right, and desired to be excused from the writing. I spoke to him in goodwill; and he told me that keeping slaves was not altogether agreeable to his mind; but that the slave being a gift made to his wife, he had accepted her.</p>		</blockquote>		<p>So, here’s the thing. Woolman had strong anti-slavery feelings, and then one day, suddenly, he finds himself directly involved in a trade. He’s not selling; he’s not buying, but he’s asked, by his employer whom he must obey, and a fellow Quaker whom he respects as an older man to act as the official witness. It happens so quick that he does it. A little later, another young Quaker asks him to do the same thing, but he’s been thinking it over, and decides he can’t do it. For the rest of his life, Woolman tried hard to convince his fellow Quakers of the evils of slavery, including personal visits and addresses to fellow Friends, and writings, including a book, Some Considerations on the Keeping of Negroes. Of course, since he died before the American Revolution, he died before slavery became outlawed in the United States, but he did have a profound impact on his own life, and on the Quaker movement in the new world, who petitioned the relatively new United States government to abolish slavery in 1790.</p>		<h2 id="on_simplicity_and_life_style">On Simplicity and “Life-style”</h2>		<p>Woolman was apparently a good worker. As I said, industry and honesty and fair-dealing can make for a good businessman, and Woolman eventually began to work for himself.</p>		<blockquote>			<p>My employer, though now a retailer of goods, was by trade a tailor, and kept a servant-man at that business; and I began to think about learning the trade, expecting that if I should settle I might by this trade and a little retailing of goods get a living in a plain way, without the load of great business. I mentioned it to my employer, and we soon agreed on terms, and when I had leisure from the affairs of merchandise I worked with his man. I believed the hand of Providence pointed out this business for me, and I was taught to be content with it, though I felt at times a disposition that would have sought for something greater; but through the revelation of Jesus Christ I had seen the happiness of humility, and there was an earnest desire in me to enter deeply into it; at times this desire arose to a degree of fervent supplication, wherein my soul was so environed with heavenly light and consolation that things were made easy to me which had been otherwise.</p>		</blockquote>		<p>He prospered, and expanded his businesses, but wondered how to live with that prosperity. He wrote:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>Through the mercies of the Almighty, I had, in a good degree, learned to be content with a plain way of living. I had but a small family; and, on serious consideration, believed truth did not require me to engage much in cumbering affairs. It had been my general practice to buy and sell things really useful. Things that served chiefly to please the vain mind in people, I was not easy to trade in; seldom did it; and whenever I did I found it weaken me as a Christian. The increase of business became my burden; for though my natural inclination was toward merchandise, yet I believed truth required me to live more free from outward cumbers; and there was now a strife in my mind between the two. In this exercise my prayers were put up to the Lord, who graciously heard me, and gave me a heart resigned to his holy will. Then I lessened my outward business, and, as I had opportunity, told my customers of my intentions, that they might consider what shop to turn to; and in a while I wholly laid down merchandise, and followed my trade as a tailor by myself, having no apprentice. I also had a nursery of apple-trees, in which I employed some of my time in hoeing, grafting, trimming, and inoculating. In merchandise it is the custom where I lived to sell chiefly on credit, and poor people often get in debt; when payment is expected, not having wherewith to pay, their creditors often sue for it at law. Having frequently observed occurrences of this kind, I found it good for me to advise poor people to take such goods as were most useful, and not costly.</p>			<p>Though trading in things useful is an honest employ, yet through the great number of superfluities which are bought and sold, and through the corruption of the times, they who apply to merchandise for a living have great need to be well experienced in that precept which the Prophet Jeremiah laid down for his scribe: “Seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not.”</p>		</blockquote>		<h2 id="stagecoaches_and_dirt_and_being_friends_with_slave_holders">Stagecoaches and dirt and being friends with slave-holders</h2>		<p>Woolman seemed to think a lot about what effect his life-style and business had on others. When he went on business trips or trips to visit other Friends, he wondered about the human cost of those newfangled stagecoaches:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>Stage-coaches frequently go upwards of one hundred miles in twenty-four hours; and I have heard Friends say in several places that it is common for horses to be killed with hard driving, and that many others are driven till they grow blind. Post-boys pursue their business, each one to his stage, all night through the winter. Some boys who ride long stages suffer greatly in winter nights, and at several places I have heard of their being frozen to death. So great is the hurry in the spirit of this world, that in aiming to do business quickly and to gain wealth the creation at this day doth loudly groan.</p>		</blockquote>		<p>And he wondered about clothes and sanitation:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>Having of late often travelled in wet weather through narrow streets in towns and villages, where dirtiness under foot and the scent arising from that filth which more or less infects the air of all thickly settled towns were disagreeable; and, being but weakly, I have felt distress both in body and mind with that which is impure. In these journeys I have been where much cloth hath been dyed, and have, at sundry times, walked over ground where much of their dye-stuffs has drained away. This hath produced a longing in my mind that people might come into cleanness of spirit, cleanness of person, and cleanness about their houses and garments.</p>			<p>Some of the great carry delicacy to a great height themselves, and yet real cleanliness is not generally promoted. Dyes being invented partly to please the eye and partly to hide dirt, I have felt in this weak state, when travelling in dirtiness, and affected with unwholesome scents, a strong desire that the nature of dyeing cloth to hide dirt may be more fully considered.</p>			<p>Washing our garments to keep them sweet is cleanly, but it is the opposite to real cleanliness to hide dirt in them. Through giving way to hiding dirt in our garments a spirit which would conceal that which is disagreeable is strengthened. Real cleanliness becometh a holy people; but hiding that which is not clean by coloring our garments seems contrary to the sweetness of sincerity. Through some sorts of dyes cloth is rendered less useful. And if the value of dye-stuffs, and expense of dyeing, and the damage done to cloth, were all added together, and that cost applied to keeping all sweet and clean, how much more would real cleanliness prevail.</p>		</blockquote>		<p>Perhaps most interesting is what happened when he visited Friends who were slaveholders:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>As it is common for Friends on such a visit to have entertainment free of cost, a difficulty arose in my mind with respect to saving my money by kindness received from what appeared to me to be the gain of oppression. Receiving a gift, considered as a gift, brings the receiver under obligations to the benefactor, and has a natural tendency to draw the obliged into a party with the giver. To prevent difficulties of this kind, and to preserve the minds of judges from any bias, was that Divine prohibition: “Thou shalt not receive any gift; for a gift bindeth the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.” (Exod. xxiii. 8.) As the disciples were sent forth without any provision for their journey, and our Lord said the workman is worthy of his meat, their labor in the gospel was considered as a reward for their entertainment, and therefore not received as a gift; yet, in regard to my present journey, I could not see my way clear in that respect. The difference appeared thus: the entertainment the disciples met with was from them whose hearts God had opened to receive them, from a love to them and the truth they published; but we, considered as members of the same religious society, look upon it as a piece of civility to receive each other in such visits; and such receptions, at times, is partly in regard to reputation, and not from an inward unity of heart and spirit. Conduct is more convincing than language, and where people, by their actions, manifest that the slave-trade is not so disagreeable to their principles but that it may be encouraged, there is not a sound uniting with some Friends who visit them. The prospect of so weighty a work, and of being so distinguished from many whom I esteemed before myself, brought me very low, and such were the conflicts of my soul that I had a near sympathy with the Prophet, in the time of his weakness, when he said: “If thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight.” (Num. xi. 15.) But I soon saw that this proceeded from the want of a full resignation to the Divine will. Many were the afflictions which attended me, and in great abasement, with many tears, my cries were to the Almighty for his gracious and fatherly assistance, and after a time of deep trial I was favored to understand the state mentioned by the Psalmist more clearly than ever I had done before; to wit: “My soul is even as a weaned child.” (Psalm cxxxi. 2.) Being thus helped to sink down into resignation, I felt a deliverance from that tempest in which I had been sorely exercised, and in calmness of mind went forward, trusting that the Lord Jesus Christ, as I faithfully attended to him, would be a counsellor to me in all difficulties, and that by His strength I should be enabled even to leave money with the members of society where I had entertainment, when I found that omitting it would obstruct that work to which I believed He had called me. As I copy this after my return, I may here add, that oftentimes I did so under a sense of duty. The way in which I did it was thus: when I expected soon to leave a Friend’s house where I had entertainment, if I believed that I should not keep clear from the gain of oppression without leaving money, I spoke to one of the heads of the family privately, and desired them to accept of those pieces of silver, and give them to such of their negroes as they believed would make the best use of them; and at other times I gave them to the negroes myself, as the way looked clearest to me. Before I came out, I had provided a large number of small pieces for this purpose and thus offering them to some who appeared to be wealthy people was a trial both to me and them. But the fear of the Lord so covered me at times that my way was made easier than I expected; and few, if any, manifested any resentment at the offer, and most of them, after some conversation, accepted of them.</p>		</blockquote>		<h2 id="his_last_days">His last days</h2>		<p>As I said, he traveled to England in 1772 to preach to the Quakers there. He contracted smallpox, and died in the city of York. His last six days were attended by Quakers, who recorded some of his last words and actions. On the day before he died, his concern for others is still evident; he is quoted as saying:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>How tenderly have I been waited on in this time of affliction, in which I may say in Job’s words, tedious days and ‘wearisome nights are appointed to me’; and how many are spending their time and money in vanity and superfluities, while thousands and tens of thousands want the necessaries of life, who might be relieved by them, and their distress at such a time as this in some degree softened by the administering of suitable things.</p>		</blockquote>		<p>After six days of illness at York, according to his published Journal:</p>		<blockquote>			<p>About a quarter before six the same morning he seemed to fall into an easy sleep, which continued about half an hour, when, seeming to awake, he breathed a few times with more difficulty, and expired without sigh, groan, or struggle.</p>		</blockquote>		<h2 id="lessons_from_john_woolmans_life">Lessons from John Woolman’s life</h2>		<p>What can we learn from John Woolman’s life? Here are a few things that I think about when I reflect on Woolman:</p>		<ol>			<li>				<p>Woolman consistently tried to live simply, peaceably and fairly in all his dealings with others. He was a small businessman all his life, I believe, but he worked hard at living out a life of conviction.</p>			</li>			<li>				<p>Woolman was willing to confront himself and others about the systemic evils they were involved in, and sought ways to see those systemic evils rooted out.</p>			</li>			<li>				<p>The “simple life” was anything but simple. Rather than live a life of quiet prosperity, Woolman let the gospel light of Christ drive him to make radical changes in his career, friendships and travel. Arguably, it led to his death, since he was on a preaching trip to England when he contracted small-pox.</p>			</li>			<li>				<p>Woolman conscientiously worked towards the eradication of the evils of slave-holding without seeing it actually eradicated, even within his own circle of Friends. He said, “Deep-rooted customs, though wrong, are not easily altered; but it is the duty of all to be firm in that which they certainly know is right for them.”</p>			</li>			<li>				<p>He was at times discouraged, but he sought ought God, and took the bad with the good. He said, “In this journey, I may say in general, we were sometimes in much weakness, and labored under discouragements, and at other times, through the renewed manifestations of Divine love, we had seasons of refreshment wherein the power of truth prevailed. We were taught by renewed experience to labor for an inward stillness; at no time to seek for words, but to live in the spirit of truth, and utter that to the people which truth opened in us.”</p>			</li>		</ol>	</div></body></html>
