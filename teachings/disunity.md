# Disunity and what to do about it

1 Corinthians 1:10-18; Matthew 4:12-23

Let me start with an obscure musical thing. One of the things that a lot of people want to do when they sing “Sacred Harp” music is to sing it “in the traditional way.” And, so, of course, we Sacred Harp singers spend a lot of time thinking and talking about what the traditional ways are. And there’s this one thing that gets talked about over and over and over again — something called “the raised sixth.” In minor music and especially in some songs, some people sing the notes just as written — kind of as if you played them on a piano, like so: la mi fa so la **fa** so la. And some people take the sixth note in the scale and raise it a bit, like so: la mi fa so la **fi** so la. 

You can imagine some young singer approaching a hoary-headed singing master and asking, 
— O wise and reverend one, what’s the traditional way? Is the tradition to sing the minor scale as written? 
— No, I don’t think so.
— So, is the tradition to “raise the sixth”? 
— No, that’s not it, either. 
— So what is the tradition? People are arguing about this over and over again!
— Ah, that’s right — **That’s** the tradition.

It seems an inevitable fact of life of any organization or movement that it will eventually embroil itself in controversy. And this is what Paul faces in Corinth, and it is what prompts his letter to them. He wastes little time getting to his point. After a few lines of praise to God, and for the people at Corinth, he begs them to be “perfectly united in mind and thought” and put all divisions behind them. Here’s what is happening — they seem to be placing an inordinate amount of emphasis of who their particular early sponsor or teacher was. Some were Paulites, some were Apolloites, some where Peterites. Others were trying to say, I think, that the only one worth naming themselves after was Christ himself, but even this move left _this_ group as a sect among the whole. 

This really upset Paul. He, of course, is a man of Christ, and he wants all to adopt this view. He reminds them that Christ was not divided — I’m unsure if Paul means to to adopt a ridiculous image of Christ being cut up into pieces for each group, or simply that Christ’s teaches and death were for all, not just some. He points out the very obvious point that people were not being baptized “into Paul,” but “into Christ.” And that Paul did not die for them; Christ did. Later on in this book he’ll point out that Paul, Peter, Apollos and others have had different roles to play in bringing the good news to those in Corinth and elsewhere, but it is God who gives the growth. He does entreat them to treat his authority with respect, but he reminds them that the factional allegiance meant nothing; what mattered was not who baptized them, but the gospel message of the cross and its saving power. He’ll remind them that they were, even in the world’s eyes, not all that important, and the gospel message was the important thing — Jesus has become their “righteousness, holiness, and redemption.”

It seems especially interesting to pair this passage from 1st Corinthians with the chapter from Matthew, which describes the very beginnings of the work and ministry of Jesus. Matthew echoes the passage we read from Isaiah — the people in darkness have seen a great light — and makes a big deal that Jesus starts his ministry from within Gentile territory, in accordance with the Old Testament promises, that when the kingdom of God comes, it will be for Jew and Gentile alike. Here, for a key example, is Daniel 7:13,14:

> I saw one like a human being coming with the clouds of heaven. And he came to the Ancient One and was presented before him. To him was given dominion and glory and kingship, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and his kingship is one that shall never be destroyed.

Jesus’s gospel message is this: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” Do you hear the echoes of Daniel there? Do you notice that this is what John was preaching, too? 

As Jesus begins to gather followers around him, we read, “Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people.” The kingdom is coming, in word and deed. We don’t have time, but we see how this story gets told by Matthew — Matthew records Jesus’s key teachings in what we call the Sermon on the Mount in chapters 5-7, and some of Jesus’s key actions in 8-9 and following.

I believe this is what Paul is especially trying to do — return the Corinthians focus on the words and actions of Jesus. And these are words we need to heed, to focus on the words and actions of Jesus. Almost parenthetically, I want to note the irony, reading this passage from the letter to the Corinthians, that our branch of the church are called _Anabaptists_ and _Mennonites_, in other words, we name ourselves after our thoughts about baptism, and we name ourselves after a significant early leader in the Anabaptist movement, Menno Simmons. I don’t think Paul would be very happy about this. In fact, I’m not sure Menno would be either, because he took as his “life verse” a quotation from Paul’s letter here, in 3:11: “For other foundation can no one lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.”

Dealing with disunity in the church is a hard and difficult question. And I almost want to say to Paul, “I’m sorry, Paul; I love you and respect you, but this idea of yours that we should be ‘perfectly united in mind and thought’ — it just isn’t going to happen.” Some of us are going to raise the sixth, and some of us aren’t. But, these passages give us important strategies for dealing with disunity. And the most important strategy is to return again and again and again to our foundation, Jesus Christ, to look at _his_ teachings, and the kind of life _he_ calls us to follow, and take hold of the power of _his_ death and resurrection. And just maybe, if we do so, we’ll be too busy thinking the right thoughts and doing the right things to be distracted into disunity.
