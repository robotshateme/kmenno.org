There are a few times in my life when I'm pretty sure I witnessed, or heard from direct witness, a miracle, or, as the people in New Testament times called it, a "wonder."

Once, my son Mark and I were helping a large crew from Reba Place Church move a family from one apartment to another. Many of the apartments in Chicago and Evanston are multi-story, and have steps in the back, and we were moving furniture and boxes up and down in a fire fighters' brigade. One high energy guy, Gus, leapt and ran around the line. And, in one of those mistakes that can happen, Gus slipped and fell from about two and a half stories and landed flat on the concrete. Mark witnessed this.

I was concerned about Mark and the trauma it might cause him, so I worked quickly to leave the work site. A trained nurse was there, and there were plenty of people to tend to him and to call an ambulance, and so forth, so I had no compunction in leaving. I remember one woman, Pam Sullivan, declaring that Gus was going to be all right, and she claimed his health as a prize before God in prayer, loudly and fervently. I can't really speak for others, but I gave Gus very little chance for life, let alone recovery. Still, I'm pretty sure Pam was one of the few faithful there. Her prayers continued, if I remember correctly, at a prayer gathering called for Gus. The news was not good.

But Gus recovered, just as Pam claimed he would. We were surprised, the doctors were surprised. But Gus recovered.

Another time: my youngest brother, Steve, married into a large Italian-Peruvian family, and his mother-in-law was on life support. The gathered family finally agreed to let her go, but they wanted to wait until one of the absent family members arrived. When he did, he insisted that she be continued on life support. The family was not, I think, happy about it, but they felt they had to go along. Some had been praying, of course, for her recovery; I'm not sure if they had a Pam Sullivan encouraging them, but she did have this advocate, although the news for her, too, was not good.

But she recovered, just as they had hoped. She had, it is wonderful to say, a complete recovery. The family was surprised, the doctors were very surprised. But she recovered.

A long time ago, the prophet Elijah, it is said, went to the Smeltertown, or (as it is called in Hebrew), Zarephath, where he was commanded by God to visit an unknown woman. That is, we don't know her name, but we know some things about her: she was poor, she was a woman, she was very hungry, she was a widow, and she had a son who became very ill, and then died. This woman, let's call her Miriyam, seems to be a bit of a gloomy person; which, I suppose, is not at all surprising given her lot and position in life. She rises up in anger towards Elijah--Elijah, a free man of Israel, with some measure of power and a direct line to the Almighty--chiding him for coming and reminding her how wretched her life was; how wretched she was. And Elijah listens; he goes into the bedroom of the son, and cries out to God; even Elijah seems to think God has been unfair to Miriyam. He lies down on the bed and covers the son. Three times he does this. 

But the Lord listens to Elijah. The son recovers, and the woman is surprised and delighted at the wonder of having her son back, and a true prophet in Israel.

A long time later another prophet came to another village in Israel called Pleasantville (or Nain as our Bible has it). He is an itinerant preacher, going from place to place preaching his gospel of peace and God's kingdom breaking into the world. As he was approaching the town, another dead man is being brought out; again, the only son of a widowed mother, whose sorrow is shared by the whole town. Without much ceremony, the prophet approaches the bier as it is being carried by the mourners, and touches it, stopping them. He speaks to the the mother--whose name, again, we do know, except she, too, is a poor widowed woman whose son died; let's call her Miriyam as well. He tells Miriyam to stop crying, and he addresses the son: "Boy, get up!" 

And the boy listens, though his sense of hearing is long gone, and his life-energy has drained away. He gets up, and returns to this life. The woman is surprised and delighted, too, I suppose; and the Bible says people were afraid, too. Who was this that could do such a wonder? A prophet, and a mighty one at that.

The third mother's name we know--it really was Miriyam, or Mary as we call her. Her son was the great prophet, whose death was truly awful and final and tortuous. He was hung on a cross, he had a sword thrust into his side to ensure he would die. He body was hurriedly brought down and put into a tomb. And Mary saw all that. But she saw the aftermath, too, the wonder of his resurrection after three days in that tomb. She saw him numerous times, wondering and "disbelieving for joy" the change that had been wrought in him; not just a great prophet; not a failed prophet hung to die by Roman authorities and religious persecution; but a risen Christ, whose gospel of the kingdom has spread through the ages and throughout the world.

Why do we have these stories of wonders? Is it because we should expect to see the dead raised as part of the normal Christian life; should we move out to the funeral homes and see the power of God at work? By no means--the sons of the widows, Lazarus, the daughter of Jairus; all of these died again. Only Jesus, the son of man and the son of God, did not die again.

No, raising the dead and the near-dead is a rare act--not an impossible act, as I can attest. We can pray, and hope, but we shouldn't berate ourselves or others for a lack of wonders of this sort, and we remember that every healing is temporary. "The living know that they must die, and in the grave forgotten lie; their memory and their sense is gone; alike unknowing, and unknown."

Rather, we look at the resurrection Lord, and remember that he is the first of many brothers and sisters to rise again. We desire to be in that band of the dead who (wonder on wonders) are raised again to new life. We take comfort that, though we see our loved ones die, there is hope of a resurrection for them.

But "deadness" is not just a thing that happens once to us. We experience little deaths every year, every month, every day. Perhaps it is a plan to change the world that dies. Or a relationship. Or we lose our sight, or days and days to illness. Or our dreams for our children are in danger. Or we are in danger of losing a job. Or we do lose a keepsake, a home, our memories. What else?

We can remember that even in the difficult times of these little deaths that God remains a God of power and love. He may not say to us, "Boy, Girl, get up!" Our experience is that this is somewhat rare, and always temporary. But God remains a God of power and love, and seeks to cooperate with us for our general good. 

What things are in danger of dying in your life? What thing has been dead so long that (as the Bible says) "it stinketh"? What is the desire of your heart? Can we pray with hope that God's power and God's love will be present?
