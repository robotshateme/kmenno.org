"Let any accept this who can" 

i'm pretty sure each of you will disagree with me in major ways this morning.

- 5:17-20 review of relationship of jesus and law. jesus came to fill up law. breaking even the smallest condemns you. but you must keep it wholly to enter the kingdom of heaven. 

anger is a kind of murder.
oaths are a kind of false testimony. 
lust is a kind of adultery.
all divorce is wrong.

- mt 19:1-11. adultery & divorce. people 'rightly' understand the impossibility of this. follow by mt 5 to drive this point home (lust is something we all feel/have as humans). 

- the general question is how to enter the kingdom in the face of this. Or how to live knowing we cannot live like this. big struggle. if we try as hard as we possibly can, we will fail. cf to programming, to gardening, to art; but in this case we are each of us called to be 'perfect.'

- a very important 2ndary question is how the community interacts with those of us who are are different places. those with power are likely to be wrong in their specific ways, but also likely to have wisdom, some progress on the way to perfection. 

- it is 'better' not to be a sexual being, in what way? opportunity costs of lust & sexuality. thinking about others sexually constantly drives out lots of opportunities for holy living. BUT we are sexual beings for much of our lives; this is what is given to us. so God gives us structures and allows society to create structures to channel these: we are made male & female; this was not a concession by God but the original plan.  

keep to the general point (the way of perfection), return to the specific point (perfect sexuality.)
