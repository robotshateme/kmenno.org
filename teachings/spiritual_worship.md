Ephesians 5:18 
Colossians 3:12-17 

= Spirit-led Worship, Spirit-led Church =

Eph 5:18 Do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit, 19 as you sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, 20 giving thanks to God the Father at all times and for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 


Col 3:12 As God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. 13 Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ​ dwell in you richly; teach and admonish one another in all wisdom; and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God.​ 17 And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.

- be filled with the Spirit (Eph) :: Let the word of Christ dwell in you (Col)
- via music
- via thanks
- via the acts of "clothing" : compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.
- via forbearance, forgiveness and peace
- via 'name-mindedness' (do everything in the Lord's name) 

In worship
- we have Col 3:16 on every bulletin
- but it's not just singing, but
- in our prayer, both 'thanks' and 'requests'
- in our understanding and our response to the word
- via forbearance with the 'messiness' of children and dogs and what _might_ happen

In our life together
- modern life says go somewhere else ... free to choose _at any time_
- but the Christian life takes time. Can't be patient instantly. 
- We will need forgiveness for one another
- pray for one another, be thankful for one another
- other ways?
