Luke 2:29-32

29 Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,   
     according to your word;   
30 for my eyes have seen your salvation,   
31 which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,   
32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles   
     and for glory to your people Israel.

## Introduction

During our four Sundays of Advent, we have been looking at, and trying to be caught up in, the great "canticles" or songs from the Christmas story as Luke presents it. These songs have been especially precious to the church over the centuries, and they all have their special names. Three weeks ago we looked at Mary's Magnificat, found in Luke 1:46-55. Then, we examined Zechariah's Benedictus (1:67-79). Last week we joined the angels in singing Gloria in Excelsis Deo (2:13-14), and this week we listen to Simeon's Nunc Dimittis (2:28-32).

## Background

After Jesus was born, Mary and Joseph brought him to the Temple as was required by their religious law. They had to offer a sacrifice because he was a first-born child, It is telling that their sacrifice was a modest one; one that you would make if you yourself were of modest means: "a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons." 

Joseph and Mary did this not just out of personal whim or desire. It was what expected of them. I think we get the idea that the holy family was all alone, but they were surrounded by a community of believers. If you take out your Christmas card, which shows Mary on a donkey carrying the baby and Joseph walking beside them, imagine there is a zoom setting on the card, and you can zoom out to see their community – their extended families, of course, but also the people among whom they lived, their religious instructors, even the shepherds of the Gloria story. And angels all around, too.

In their extended community were old people, obviously, and we meet two of them in this chapter. Anna, who is at least 84 years old who is at the temple all the time (just to be clear, probably not "all the time"; it's unlikely that she lived there, but "all the time," she spent a lot of time at the temple).

And Simeon. We don't really know that he's an old man, actually. But he has been promised that he wouldn't die before he saw the Messiah. 

How did he know this? Our scripture says the Holy Spirit "rested on him." He lived with the Spirit on him. And the same Spirit told him this, and Simeon believed it. 

I find it interesting that Simeon is the only person in the history of the world to whom it was revealed that he would see Jesus's coming; everyone else since then has been wrong, wrong, wrong!

Anyway, Simeon does seem especially sensitive to the Spirit's movement, as was the prophet Anna. Both of the seem to immediately recognize who Jesus is, and the special place he was to play, immediately. Of Anna, it is said that she understood "at that moment." Of Simeon, it looks like Simeon simply came up to the holy family as they were performing their religious duties, and takes Jesus into his arms. 

Can't you just see him?

And as he holds Jesus, he sings, just as Mary did, as Zechariah did, and as the angels did. Here is his song:

> “Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,  
>    according to your word;  
> for my eyes have seen your salvation,  
>    which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,  
>  a light for revelation to the Gentiles  
>    and for glory to your people Israel.”

## The song

Do you notice that Simeon's theme is the same as the other singers? Namely, that this is the turning point of the world. Mary remembers the promises God made to her ancestors, and how God was to bring about a new kingdom of mercy where the low, the meek, and the hungry are lifted up. And Zechariah rejoiced to see his son was to play a part in rescue of Israel from their enemies. The angels declare that God's peace is coming to those on earth. 

And now Simeon understands that the promise given to him by the Holy Spirit has come about: his eyes have seen the salvation of God, "in the presence of all people."

But Simeon spells out something this is only hinted at. It will not only be Israel who will receive this salvation. But this baby will be "a light for revelation to the Gentiles" as well as glory for Israel.

By the way, there's that word "glory" again. Simeon is under the dome of the spreading peace of God, the glory and light that spreads through the world wherever Jesus is centered.

Simeon is quoting Isaiah's image of the coming Servant in Isaiah 42 and 49:

> I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness,  
    I have taken you by the hand and kept you;  
I have given you as a covenant to the people,  
    a light to the nations,  
     to open the eyes that are blind,  
to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,  
    from the prison those who sit in darkness.  
    
and    

> “It is too light a thing that you should be my servant  
    to raise up the tribes of Jacob  
    and to restore the survivors of Israel;  
I will give you as a light to the nations,  
    that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.”  

Simeon, in his meditations and waiting for the coming Messiah, would be very much aware of these  words, of the image of the Suffering Servant would was to come to save not only Israel, but to be the light of all humankind. 

So Simeon shares the good news that the light would spread to all humankind to receive.

Simeon is aware, too, that the light was, in some sense, not just good or easy news. He professes to Mary that Jesus was to raise up many of Israel, but some would stumble over his message, as we clearly see did happen as we read the gospels through. And although he delights that the light is  truly coming to the Gentiles, I think he understood that many Gentiles would stumble, too. 

And he also notes that Mary would pay a cost for this, too, that he would pierce her heart. Little did she know how Jesus would run off to study with elders in the temple, "his father's house" at age 12 (Luke 2). Or that he would describe his true family as those who "hear the word of God and do it" (Luke 8), and when some woman was overcome with fandom and cried out "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts that nursed you!" Jesus responds again that the blessed ones are those who hear the word of God and do it (Luke 11). 

Mary pondered these things though, and we see in Luke's account of the early church, that Mary is included in "those constantly devoting themselves to prayer" (Acts 1)

## Meaning what?

What do we learn from this?

- We learn that good things can happen to those who show up at God's house and are attentive to God's spirit.
- We learn that the gospel message isn't an easy message, but it is a good one.
- We note that God can speak through people even in old age.
- We learn that even the Messiah was raised in a community that raised and formed him.
- We praise God that the gospel message has come to even us.
- We note that we can be involved in spreading the gospel light to others, both near and far.

May you have a blessed and peaceful Christmas, celebrating the light that has come to the nations.
