## Wise and Foolish Virgins ##

> 25 “Then the kingdom of heaven will be like this. Ten bridesmaids[a] took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.[b] 2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. 3 When the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them; 4 but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. 5 As the bridegroom was delayed, all of them became drowsy and slept. 6 But at midnight there was a shout, ‘Look! Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ 7 Then all those bridesmaids[c] got up and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 9 But the wise replied, ‘No! there will not be enough for you and for us; you had better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’ 10 And while they went to buy it, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet; and the door was shut. 11 Later the other bridesmaids[d] came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’ 12 But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I do not know you.’ 13 Keep awake therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.

This is a hard story, and I want to stay with its difficulty. In the middle, I'll ease up from the harshness, but in the end, we'll return to its stark claims.

I wonder if the foolish bridesmaids had regrets. 

- Did they regret not bringing oil in the first place?
- Did they regret not rushing off to get oil as soon as they realized they didn't have any?
- Did they regret not asking the wise bridesmaids earlier?
- Did they regret being in the wedding party in the first place?

They've made their bed and they have to lie in it; they made their choices, and now they really do suffer the consequences. Their regrets are not useful, of course, because they don't help them change.

But this story is told for us, to be a warning for us. It tells us that we shouldn't be foolish, but wise. 

We take on, and we have taken on, the difficult and even dangerous task of following Jesus Christ. What that looks like differs for each of us. Some of us have chosen to raise children not our own. Some of us have chosen to comfort and love the sick and dying. Some of us have chosen to face conflict squarely. We have chosen to live a life of peace and peacemaking. A life of simplicity, service, peace, worship, community. To follow Jesus. 

Like the virgins, we have companionship on our journey. Like the virgins, we have seen some of our number, Christian friends and family, fail and even betray us. We even face (according to the story) the danger of not being recognized by the Lord whom we have chosen to serve; we could be _that_ wrong.  But we are still called to be disciples. This is the bed we have made, and we must lie in it. We have made our choices, and we must live with the consequences of living the life to which we have been called.

That's the hard word.

Here's an easier word. We are told elsewhere in Scripture — not in contradiction but in a fullness — that "now, therefore, there is no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus." (Romans 8:1). We are told that we have been cleansed through the washing of the water through the word (Ephesians 5:25); that is, in our baptism and response to the gospel word given us, we are clean. We don't have to worry, despite our failures. 

Even our regrets are washed away. Even our shame cannot condemn us. 

But back to the hard word:

- We need to "keep watch." The rest of this chapter (the parable of the talents) indicates that this is not so much looking for signs of Jesus's return, but to look for signs of ways to invest our lives in the work of Jesus' kingdom. 
- We need "oil in our lamps." Whenever oil is mentioned, we should look for indications of the Holy Spirit. We need the Holy Spirit to help us look for the signs of working in Jesus's kingdom.
- We need to pull together, for we are all fools sometimes. We remember that Scripture tells us that "we who are strong out to bear with those who are weak." We who are fools should look to the wise for wisdom, and we are all to share the wisdom we have.

Psychological studies indicate that, in the short run, we regret things we did (like eat that cake, or run that stop sign). But, in the long run, the things we most regret are the things we didn't do. What are ways of pursuing the fruit of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control) that you have chosen, would like to choose to reaffirm this week?
