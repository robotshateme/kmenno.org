Luke 1:46-55    
   
   
46 And Mary said,   
“My soul magnifies the Lord,   
47       and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,   
48       for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant.   
Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;   
49       for the Mighty One has done great things for me, 
and holy is his name.   
50       His mercy is for those who fear him 
from generation to generation.   
51       He has shown strength with his arm;   
he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.   
52       He has brought down the powerful from their thrones,   
and lifted up the lowly;   
53       he has filled the hungry with good things,   
and sent the rich away empty.   
54       He has helped his servant Israel,   
in remembrance of his mercy,   
55       according to the promise he made to our ancestors,   
to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”

## Introduction

This is the first Sunday in Advent, the first of four Sundays of preparation and watching for the coming of the baby Jesus, as we also await his return in fulness. Usually, we stay with the lectionary passages during this time, but this year I would like to try something a little different. I like the idea of being in a watching and waiting mode. But, given how our church meets, it means that we don't get to dwell very long on the Christmas story.

So, this year, God helping us, we will spend more time with the Christmas story.

And it struck me that there are four beautiful, rich poems that are found in Luke's version of the Christmas story, and how much I love them and would like to spend some time thinking and praying and preaching through them.

These four songs are so special, that they have been given their own names. In many Christian traditions, they are read or sung regularly as part of the liturgy.

The four are Mary's _Magnificat_, found in Luke 1:46-55; Zechariah's _Benedictus_ (1:67-79); the angels' _Gloria in Excelsis_ (2:13-14); and Simeon's _Nunc Dimittis_ (2:28-32).

And so each Sunday will will take one of these songs and look at them. We'll have two songs of preparation, a song at Jesus's birth, and a song sung at his presentation in the Temple. 

## Mary meets Elizabeth

Dear Mary. She has been visited by an angel who at first frightens her, and then calms her, and tells her God has found favor with her. And he gives her the astounding news: the Holy Spirit will overshadow her, she will become pregnant, and bear a son who will be the called "Son of God," "Son of the Most High," and be the recipient of the crown of David, her ancestor. His reign will be forever.

And she meekly accepts this word: "Here I am, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word."

And the angel, Gabriel, tells her to go to visit her relative Elizabeth, who was old and unable to bear a child, but now is also miraculously with child. 

Mary rushes out to the hill country where Elizabeth lives, and just as she enters the room, the child within Elizabeth quickens, and Elizabeth, filled with the Holy Spirit, cries, "Bless are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb."

And what does Mary do? She sings:

My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,  
and my spirit sings for joy to my Saviour God!  
His lowly slave he looked upon in love;  
they will call me happy now, for mighty are the works  
he has done, and holy is his name.

In every age, for those who fear the Lord  
come his mercy and the strength of his mighty arm:  
he routs the proud, throws monarchs off their thrones,  
while he lifts the lowly high, fills hungry ones with food,  
and the rich sends empty away.

To Israel his servant he brings help  
and the promise to our fathers is now fulfilled;  
for Christ has come, according to his word,  
and the mercy that he showed to Abraham is now  
for his children's children evermore.

## Songs of rejoicing by Biblical women

Mary is caught up in the Spirit in song. She's not the first! There is a long history of women caught singing in the Bible.

If you start from the beginning of the Bible, the first song you will reach will be the Song of Miriam. Miriam is the sister of Moses, and after Moses had led the Israelites safely 


- Song of Miriam (Exodus 15), a God is our salvation ("I will sing unto the Lord")
- Song of Deborah (Judges 5), God the victor. Mentioning Jael, "blessed among women"
- Song of Hannah (Samuel 2:1-10)
  - about a miraculous child
  - exults in God
  - full of reversals (poor/rich; low/high; hungry/full; hungry/rich)
  - look on thy maidservant
  
Mary is caught up in the story.

We should be caught up in the story.
