# Darkness in the Manger

## Matthew 1:18-25
18 Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. 19 Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. 20 But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." 22 All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 23 "Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel," which means, "God is with us."24 When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, 25 but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus.
## Introduction
Bess has bring bringing us this very interesting series of meditations during Advent about “Where does God live?” And we have watched the candles being extinguished rather than being lit as the weeks of Advent have passed. We have seen God in God’s great glory;  in less light, in community; in even less light, in the desert and wilderness; and finally, to day, in even less light in the manger.
For my meditation, I’d like to mention a few ways that God is _hidden_ in the darkness of the nativity story.
### A hidden pregnancy
### A secret divorce
### A birth in a manger
### A God in the womb
