1 Peter 5

In this final chapter, Peter gives instructions about elders, some more moral instructions, and some final greetings.

Let's look at what his says to Christian elders, which, for Peter means those people who have the responsibility of caring for "the flock of God." Everybody bears some responsibility, of course, but some are called to oversight.  In our small church, this actually falls on a number of people. I am the officially designated pastor of our church – officially designated by the Indiana-Michigan Conference. But CarolSue is also ordained in the conference, and she bears a lot of the responsibility of teaching. And Michael, if our conference ever gets its act together, will be licensed here as well. Barb and Janine are our church council, along with me. And I think we'd all agree that Bess exercises quite a bit of caring for the church as a whole.

Peter's exhortation to us is to bear these responsibilities willingly, not because we feel like we have to do it. Frankly, this is hard for me at times, and I ask for your prayer. I sometimes feel a kind of spiritual oppression trying to prevent me from doing my best, but I accept the responsibility for any lack of willingness.  

Peter also says we shouldn't do this out of a desire for monetary gain. It gives me pleasure that we don't yet pay our leaders, though there is nothing wrong with that. Paul tells us that workers are worthy of their hire. Still, not getting any money means that the temptation for monetary gain is removed.

We are also not to lord it over the others in the church. Again, this is sometimes hard for me. I want, at some level, to issue orders and have you obey them — this might surprise you, but I do, sometimes. Thank God that you don't! 

I don't know if we will "win the crown of glory that never fades away," but I do ask for your prayers for me and Bess, for CarolSue and Michael, for Barb and Janine.

On the other hand, Peter is quite clear that we should accept the authority of those who are elders. This isn't an unquestioning obedience, but a call to take elders seriously and soberly. All of us must be "clothed in humility," leaders and non-leaders alike. This humility means acknowledging we might not always know what is best for ourselves, and we need to listen to the outside council of others. Sometimes, this humility means accepting the leadership of others even when we disagree. We know that someday God will exalt us in due time.

Moving on from talking about the leaders, Peter again points out that our lives are very serious business, and that we need to be serious and disciplined in our Christian lives. 

His image of the devil prowling like a lion waiting to devour us, each of us. That is a very serious image. We fight not against flesh and blood, as Paul writes, but there really are spiritual beings and spiritual realities that seek our harm. And we are a resistance movement in the face of these assaults, along with many brothers and sisters who are also being assaulted.

But this assault is only for a time. God in Christ will eventually "restore, support, strengthen and establish" us. 

At the Mennonite Relief Sale, I bought a little booklet first published in the 30's, and this edition was from the late 50's. It is volume 4 of a Sunday school or Christian formation series called "Lessons in Christian Doctrine." This volume is called "Living the Christian Life." It's actually pretty good; a serious volume for a serious task. 1 Peter is quoted often! It covers a lot of aspects that were important to the "Old" Mennonites, including living simply a live conformed to God, doing good for evil and being non-resistant, using our resources and speech wisely, establishing and maintaining Christian homes, living lives as good citizens, cherishing the Sabbath, witnessing for Christ, and generally, living a life that models Christian love.

In some ways, it's a very simple, straightforward programme; Christian living summed up in just 96 pages. 

> Among the essential means to Christian growth are the study of God's Word, the practice of regular prayer and devotion, the fellowship with other Christians in the Church, and submission to Christ in a life of obedience and service. The abundant life which Christ came to bring ... is available to those who seek to grow in the grace and in the knowledge of their Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.

I think in many ways, we have made things pretty complicated for ourselves; or better, perhaps, we have allowed the complications in the world to seep into our lives so completely that we forget the basics of Christian discipleship. I think that perhaps this is one of the wiles of the devil. Peter calls us to "cast all of our anxiety" on God because God loves us so. What would it mean to cast all of the cares of the world on God? To rely on God to "restore, support, strengthen and establish" us?

My thoughts are not complete on this, and I would be glad for yours.

Finally, Peter sends some greetings. In it, he explains his reason for writing; he wants to encourage his listeners and to testify to the true grace of God, which we are to stand fast in. 

Let me encourage you to think on these things, and to rely on God's grace.
