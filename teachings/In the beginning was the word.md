John 1:1-18  

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being 4 in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. 5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.
  
 > 6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. 8 He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. 9 The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.
 10 He was in the world, and the world came into being through him; yet the world did not know him. 11 He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. 12 But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, 13 who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God. 
 
 > 14 And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father’s only son, full of grace and truth. 15 (John testified to him and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’”) 16 From his fullness we have all received, grace upon grace. 17 The law indeed was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has ever seen God. It is God the only Son, who is close to the Father’s heart, who has made him known[^1].

Today's gospel lesson is a chapter about beginnings, which is very appropriate for this, the first Sunday of the calendar year. The Christmas and New Year's celebrations are over, and it's somewhat a time of new beginnings.

But of course, John is not talking about the beginning of a new year, but the beginning of everything.

He is deliberately echoing the beginning of Genesis: "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth." In John's disarmingly simple language, he brings to us three big themes:

- Jesus as the Word, bringing life
- Jesus as the light, illuminating the world
- Jesus as flesh, living among us


## Jesus as the Word, bringing life

As I said, John echoes the Genesis account. But rather than talk about the first event – God creating the heavens and the earth – we read "In the beginning was the Word." That is, the Word existed before the world existed. And there is this radical identification of the Word with God: the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Whatever God is, that's what the Word is. 

The Genesis account of creation is a series of "and God said…" God speaks, and things start happening and being created. That is, the world is created by God's word (little-w) in Genesis's account, and by God's Word (big-W) in John's account. 

Here's an interesting thing. Over and over again, we see "the word of the Lord" coming to God's prophets, both in the Old Testament as well as the New. But not once does the Bible ever say "the word of the Lord" comes to Jesus. This is because Jesus is the Word of God; he in his being and in his self, is the Word of the Lord.

Why did God create the world? We see that everything, everything, everything comes into being by the Word of God. Interestingly, our translation says everything that comes into being is _life itself_. God wanted to bring things to life, and life to a people that he graciously calls his own. He came to give us life, abundant life.


## Jesus as the Light, illuminating the world

Jesus comes to us as the light, illuminating those who are darkness. If you remember your Genesis account, _light_ is the first thing that God creates. It predates even the creation of the sun, moon, and stars. Of course, light is a very significant image in the Old Testament. Light is even called God's clothing. In Psalm 104 it says:


>    Bless the LORD, O my soul.  
   O LORD my God, you are very great.  
   You are clothed with honor and majesty,  
   wrapped in light as with a garment.  

But it's important to remember language like this is just an image; we don't believe God wears light like a suit. The important thing about light is not its being, but the relationship it describes. Jesus illuminates us, who live in darkness.

Several times Jesus takes up this theme in John:


> Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.” (John 8:12) 

and:

> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. (John 9:5)

and:

> I have come as light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in the darkness. (John 12:46)

In doing so, he says he wants us to become the children of light:

> While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.(Jn 12:36)

It's not in John, but in Matthew's gospel, Jesus tells his disciples:

> You are the light of the world. (Matthew 5:14) 

I think it's really interesting that John the Baptist gets a mention here. We are told he wasn't the light, but someone who was pointing to the light. Interestingly, when Jesus speaks of John the Baptist later, he says: 

> He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light. (Jn 5:35)

This is very consistent with our call to be children of light. We are little lights, pointing out, as it were, the real light. Our little and imperfect love for one another and for others is a signpost to the true light and life found in Jesus. As Ephesians says, "the fruit of the light is found in all that is good and right and true." (Eh 5:8-9)

We have seen his glory, the complete light and reflection of God; the perfect Son. 

Just as the shepherds saw the glory of the angels under the dome of God's glory, so we sense the glory and light of knowing Jesus, the true light. We sense this in imperfect and shattered ways, but we still sense it, and we can help others to come into the light of knowing Jesus's way of grace and truth.


## Jesus as Flesh, living among us

But we are not left with a God who remains outside of history, in either just speaking to create it, or shining light to illuminate it.

The Word – the light – becomes flesh. The Word becomes a baby. The baby grows up, is baptized by John, and walked among us. If you had been there, you could have shaken hands with God, received a physical touch of healing, split a loaf of bread and jar of wine that you ate and drank, and that he ate and drank. 

He was a human being, a specific man in a specific time and place, which is why, of course, we have experienced none of these things, anymore than we can meet our great-great-great-grandparents or great-great-great-grandchildren. 

But even as a human being, the glory of the Word and the light was evident; even as a human being, he reflected the fulness of God. 

And he brought us directly: grace and truth. The Theological dictionary of the New Testament says, "the transition from pre-existence to history is the true theme."of John's prologue[^2]. God the Word, who existed before anything existed, and who brought everything into existence, thus enters time, and enters our human time.

He was close to the Father's heart, and then he came close to us, bringing us the grace of providing an illuminated path to God, and the truth of how to enter that path. No one has ever seen God, until God came to us in the flesh.

No wonder John strains to describe it well.

So we remember:

- Jesus is the Word who brings us life
- Jesus is the light, illuminating the world
- Jesus came in the flesh, living among us
