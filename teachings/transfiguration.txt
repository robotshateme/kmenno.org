* Transfiguration
  Mark 9:2-9 Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and
   John, and led them up a high mountain apart, by themselves. And he
   was transfigured before them, and his clothes became dazzling
   white, such as no one on earth could bleach them. And there
   appeared to them Elijah with Moses, who were talking with Jesus.

   9:5 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here;
   let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one
   for Elijah." He did not know what to say, for they were terrified.

9:7 Then a cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud there came a
    voice, "This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!" Suddenly when
    they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only
    Jesus.

9:9 As they were coming down the mountain, he ordered them to tell no
    one about what they had seen, until after the Son of Man had risen
    from the dead.
