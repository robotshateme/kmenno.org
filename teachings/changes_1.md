= Changes (1) = 
Luke 15:1-6

Recently, I've been thinking a lot about how people change for the better.  I'm interested in self-change--what it is we can do to see positive change in ourselves--and change in others--what it is we can do to see positive change in others. Now, it will probably be the case that this question is too general, but I'd like to kick off a mini-series on the question of change. We'll see how far it goes!

Before we begin, though, it's important, as Christians, to understand that "change" has scriptural warrant. And it's not at all hard to find this warrant. In Matthew's gospel, the very first word of Jesus as he starts his public ministry is a word of change: "*Repent*, for the kingdom of heaven has come near." _Repent_ means, of course, to _turn around_; that is to change your direction. We have a GPS unit in our car, and it gives us what it thinks are the shortest direction to our goal location. Recently, we missed our turn-off, and our GPS unit, "Mina," eventually noticed we were heading in the wrong direction. She said, "Recalculating route," and told us to turn off at the next exit and make a U-turn. We needed to _repent_, to _turn around_, to _change directions_; that was the shortest path to where we wanted to go, even though we were a bit frustrated at our need to do so. In any case, we see that from Jesus's own words that _positive change_ is an important idea.

The first point I want to make about change in our selves and others is that we can rely on God to be on our side as we seek positive change. We can see this in the gospel passage for today:

> 15:1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming near to listen to him. 2 And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling and saying, “This fellow welcomes sinners and eats with them.” 
3 So he told them this parable: 4 “Which one of you, having a hundred sheep and losing one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one that is lost until he finds it? 5 When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders and rejoices. 6 And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.’ 7 Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.  (The Holy Bible : New Revised Standard Version. 1989 (Lk 15:1–7). Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers.) 

This parable is called "The Parable of the Lost Sheep," for obvious reasons. This sheep doesn't have a GPS unit. It is on its own, lost in a place where it is unlikely to get back to where it belongs. Being a sheep, it perhaps doesn't even know that it is lost. It takes the shepherd's "tender care" to notice that it is lost, and the shepherd takes extraordinary effort and even risk to go out to find the sheep and bring it back.

And notice how happy the shepherd is when he finds the sheep and brings it back. He has a party to celebrate. (And, of course, I refer you to Bess's teaching last week to understand this better). The shepherd *enjoys* bringing the sheep back to the fold. The shepherd wants all of his sheep to be safe.

You may know that I've been reading a lot of Julian of Norwich, who mediated long and hard on God's attitude towards sinners like us. And here is a short quotation from her about how God longs to do us good:

> I saw three ways of longing in God, all with the same good ... The first is that God longs to teach us to know Him and love Him for ever, as conveniently and speedily for us as possible. The second is that God longs to bring us up to His bliss, like souls taken out of their pain into heaven. The third is that God longs to fill us full of bliss; that shall be on the last day: fulfilled forever and ever. (My translation)

== Seeking change ==

Perhaps it would be good to write down in a secret place some change that you hope to see in yourself, and some changes that you hope to see in others. Perhaps that is something you want to repent of; perhaps it is just some improvement in your material or spiritual life you hope to obtain. Perhaps you have some loved ones whom you wish to know God better, to give their lives over to God. Perhaps you wonder yourself if a life lived for God is worth the doing. 

And, having made this list, let me suggest that you spend some time meditating on how much God longs for that change to happen. I hope one of two things will happen: either God may persuade you that this is not a change for you or others to make at this time, or that God may fill you with hope and gratitude because of his power and love towards you and others.

Now, you might just commit this list in your heart, and that will be fine. But you might physically write it down, too, so that you can return to it later, and see what how God has worked.
