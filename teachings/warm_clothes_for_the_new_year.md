== The passage == 

12 As God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. 13 Bear with one another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each other; just as the Lord​f​ has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. 15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be thankful. 16 Let the word of Christ​dwell in you richly; teach and admonish one another in all wisdom; and with gratitude in your hearts sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God.​17 And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. (Colossians 3:12-17)

== The church I want to go to ==  

I have been thinking a lot this week about the upcoming year, and what it could mean and will mean for the Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship. This passage from Colossians reminds us of some of the stances we need to take with one another. It describes (in part) the kind of church I'd really like to be part of.

In this church, people surround themselves with compassion for one another. People don't suffer or celebrate alone, but have others in the body who support them when they are down, and rejoice with them when they are up. I want to go to this church. 

In this church, kindness reigns. People don't look for opportunities to share a cutting remark about one another, or other people or churches or groups, but act in kindness towards one another.  I want to go to this church.

In this church, people don't think of themselves as better than others, either in the church or outside it. They know their proper place and have pride under control. They know where their gifts and abilities come from, and use them properly, for service, not self-service.  I want to go to this church.

In this church, people are patient with each other. They know the truth of the old proverb, "Be kind. For everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle." They know that others are as frail and full of need as they are. When others say something that could be taken in a mean way, or a good way, they'll assume the good unless they have good reason to think otherwise. They know that children aren't little adults. The young people and the older people know that they often see the world in different ways, but that the other group just might be interested and interesting and teachable. I want to go to this church. 

In this church, people sometimes fail, but people are quick to forgive one another because they remember how much they have been forgiven. I want to go to this church.

In this church, there isn't a spirit of power, or a party spirit, or a spirit of discontent; there isn't a spirit of anger or a spirit of narrowness, but a spirit of love, which surrounds the church and brings it together. People live out their love for one another, and it creates a kind of harmony that is as sweet to see as it is to experience. I want to go to this church. 

This church is a church of peace. This church is a thankful church. This church pays attention to the teachings of Jesus and the word his Spirit has for it. This church teaches one another about the things of God, and daily increases in wisdom. This church even goes into the deep places of brokenness and sin in one another's lives, and encourages change and restoration. I want to go to this church.

And this church loves to sing and make music. This church knows that music isn't just an add-on to its spiritual life, but a key part of its life together. It looks for ways to express its deepest emotions of thankfulness and praise, singing the words of Scripture and other spiritual songs for God's glory, but not its own. I want to go to this church.

In everything this church does, God is thanked. Jesus's name is invoked, not as a semi-magical incantation, but as the sign of who they are together: followers and fellow heirs of Jesus. They speak _and_ act in the name of the Lord, as Jesus's representatives and disciples. I want to go to this church!

== Getting to church ==

The question is -- how will I find this church?  And I think there are two ways: one is to search for it. The other is to make it. 

So, let me ask--what are some ways that we can make Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship a church that these verses describe?
