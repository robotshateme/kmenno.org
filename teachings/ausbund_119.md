# A song from the heart #

The nucleus of the book (now part II beginning with hymn No. 81) consists of 51 hymns written by a number of Anabaptists  (those called Philippites) in the dungeons of the castle of Passau on the Danube (Bavaria) where they lay imprisoned between 1535 and 1540, many of them later martyred. Twelve of these hymns were written by Hans Betz  who died in 1537 in prison, and 11 by Michael Schneider, the leader of the group. (Wolkan was able to identify most of the otherwise unknown writers.)

Sometime in the late 1530s, in what is now Bavaria, in a castle called Passau, a group of early Anabaptists were imprisoned for their faith. Some of them died in prison, and others were killed for what they believed in. But while in prison, some of them started writing hymns, sung to folk tunes they already knew. Eventually, 51 of these hymns were written down, and, in 1594, were published, and circulated, although only one copy is known today, and it is held in the Goshen library, not 100 miles away from here.

The hymns spoke comfort to a people suffering for their beliefs. Over time, additional hymns were added, and the German-speaking Mennonites and Amish who migrated to the United states in the 1700s brought the expanded hymnbook with them. This hymnbook, called the _Ausbund_, is still used by the Amish (and some conservative Mennonites) today. It is the oldest hymnbook in continuous use today.

There is one hymn, number 119 in the current editions (but, I believe, one of the original hymns written in Passau) is used in Amish communion services, which are generally held twice a year. The Amish practice foot-washing--that is, as part of their communion service, they wash one another's feet, as Jesus did his disciples' feet at the Last Supper. The Mennonite Church also affirms foot-washing; as it says in the Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective (Article 13):

> We believe that Jesus Christ calls us to serve one another in love as he did. Rather than seeking to lord it over others, we are called to follow the example of our Lord, who chose the role of a servant by washing his disciples' feet.

> Just before his death, Jesus stooped to wash the disciples' feet and told them, "So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that you also should do as I have done to you." In this act, Jesus showed humility and servanthood, even laying down his life for those he loved. In washing the disciples' feet, Jesus acted out a parable of his life unto death for them, and of the way his disciples are called to live in the world.

> Believers who wash each other's feet show that they share in the body of Christ. They thus acknowledge their frequent need of cleansing, renew their willingness to let go of pride and worldly power, and offer their lives in humble service and sacrificial love.  

A friend of mine from Texas, who is working on a song book of foot-washing songs, asked me to translate this hymn for him. It's been a good experience for me to do so, to connect with these martyrs of old, to try to understand their old language and desires, to think about how to translate this into English in the 21st century. I'm grateful for my friend Bill Beverly who helped me in the translation, for I am not a German scholar, especially of 16th century German. 

== Singing from the Heart ==

This morning, I'd like to share some of the themes and images found in this hymn. I know this is an unusual thing to do, and I suppose I'm not even sure you'll find it useful or even interesting, but it's what I have today. 

Although I won't go through all the verses one-by-one (did I mention there were twenty-five?), let me read you the first two verses:

Verse 1  
From the heart, we desire to sing  
In peace and unity,  
With diligence and earnestness heading  
Towards perfection.  
That we might please God, 
This is what God wills;  
Hearken, all ye righteous,  
Let this enter your heart.  


Verse 2  
O God! Thou desirest to give us,  
Now and in every hour  
To live in Thy word  
To keep your covenant,  
You desire to make us perfect 
In peace and unity  
That will find us awake,  
And always ready.

This is a hymn, and so we start out singing. The theme of living life "from the heart" is important in this hymn; we want to sing from the heart, in "peace and unity"--a phrase that appears several times in the hymn. 

In life, we are meant to please God, and this takes all of our energy and attention. This is something we are meant to take to heart. God wants to make us perfect, ready for God's return. 

== The Reign of God == 

In the next few verses, we pick up the theme of the _Reign oF God_. Jesus cries out, calling to all who will listen, to join him in a journey to God's Reign, where we can reign and live forever. God calls us to start living out this Reign right here on earth, and Jesus teaches us in the Lord's prayer ("Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven"), and in his call to us to "be perfect, even as God is perfect." The door stands open, for all who would enter into the Reign of God--but we must put to death our old way of life, to get rid of "the old yeast" in our lives.

Verse 3  
Mt 11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 

When Thou criest out,  
O Lord Jesus Christ 
Saying to all the righteous,  
"Come, ye who are prepared  
I will go with you, leading you  
In my Father's Kingdom  
Where ye shall reign  
And live forever." 

Verse 4  
In the kingdom that God prepares  
There is great unity.  
Peace, Joy, at all times  
From now to eternity.  
If we want to gain the Kingdom,  
The great unity,  
We have to begin on earth;  
[So] that we become prepared.  


Verse 5  
Mt 6:10 Thy kingdom, come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  
Mt. 5:48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father, which is in heaven is perfect.

Then our Father's will  
We must right now  
Fullfill on earth at all times  
As in the Kingdom of Heaven.  
Thus we are taught by  
Our Lord Jesus Christ  
That we may become perfect  
As our Father is.  

Verse 6  
Rev 3:20  Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.  

Ro 8:13 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  

All who now hope  
To obtain this Kingdom,  
The door now stands open  
It is there for all to see  
Those who would inherit the Kingdom  
Must, here on earth,  
Completely mortify the flesh  
That it might be renewed.  

Verse 7  
1 Co 5:7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:  

Diligently, he must purge out  
Of his own heart  
The old leaven,  
There, in its place, plant  
The Goodness (Virtue) of Jesus Christ  
Which He, Himself, teaches,  
For this, he will prepare us  
At all times on this earth.  


== Humility and Service ==

Life in the reign of God: What does it look like? The great theme of the the song is humility and service. Jesus says that he did not come to be served, but to serve, and lay down his life. And, if Jesus does this, we must follow his example. Jesus showed his unspotted love for us in his death of the cross, and we are called to a life of humble self-sacrifice.

The symbolic example of this is when Jesus washed his disciples feet. We should do the same, for Jesus directly commands it. This symbol is part of Jesus's new commandment that we should love one another. Here's what it says in John:

> John 13:12-15 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.  

> John 13:34f A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.

Verse 8  
So take to heart  
The goodness of Jesus Christ  
As He did not come to be  
Served at any time.  
He said, I came not  
To be served,  
But for all the righteous  
to lay down my life.  

Matthew 20:26b-28. Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant: Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.  

1 John 3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.  

Verse 9  
With this He shows  
Humility and lowliness  
There the great love  
He showed them.  
Since He on earth has been  
Always with to his disciples.  
He washed their feet for them,  
He showed them love.  

John 13:1,3-5 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them unto the end. ... Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God; He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself. After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. 

Verse 10  
So he said to them:  
Let you take this to heart  
What I have done for you  
Is an example for you.  
Love one another,  
This is my Father's will  
No one should do otherwise.  

John 13:12-15 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.  

John 13:34f A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.  

Verse 11  
He showed his love  
With all of his might:  
There on our behalf  
He was hung on a cross.  
Love is unspotted  
With Him at all times,  
Those who desire to enjoy this  
Must do the same as He.  


== Love in action ==

It's not enough to say that we love God, or that we love one another; we have to show this by our actions. Love isn't something we do in just our words (as John writes), but in deeds. 

For example, if we have something of the world's wealth, and see a brother (or sister, of course) in need, and do nothing about it, we are demonstrating that we are _not_ living in God's kingdom. If we are not faithful with the these little things, how will God trust us with eternal things? 

We are reminded that Jesus had the greatest riches of all: he could have counted himself equal with God, but instead, he took on the form of a poor servant--_our_ servant. Again, we should follow his example if we want to live his life of peace and unity.

Verse 12  
1 John 3:18 

My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.  

Do we want to be like Christ?  
We must at all times  
Love one another on earth  
Not only in words [with the mouth]  
But with true deeds  
Just as John wrote,  
"Whoever loves with words,"  
This is where love abides.  

Verse 13  
1 John 3:17 

But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 

Whoever has the world's goods,  
Whether little or great,  
And sees his brother  
Suffering in need  
And will not give to him quickly  
The gift he has received  
How would then his life  
Be given to him in death?  

Luke 16:11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? 

Verse 14  
Whoever here, in small things,  
Is not found faithful,  
And seeks only his own,  
Then it would seem: 
Who will trust him then  
With eternal good?  
So, let us look to those,  
Keeping love in mind.  

Verse 15  
Paul shows us that  
Through God's grace, with diligence,  
If none seeks his own  
Nor seek his own glory  
Then we shall find  
Humility and lowliness  
That we might glorify God  
In peace and unity.  

Verse 16  
Phil 2:5-8 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.  

Therefore be of the same mind  
As Jesus Christ--  
Even though He is called  
A Son of God Most High,  
He did consider Himself  
Equal to His Father  
But sought with all diligence  
To be our servant.  

Verse 17  
Then He took on  
The image of a poor servant;  
He came to earth,  
Forsook His great power.  
He would at all times show  
Love and humility.  
Therefore, let us also, with diligence  
Follow His example.  

Verse 18  
That we may attain  
Love in purity  
Which does not grow cold  
At any time in us  
But would rather do much more  
In us, with all diligence,  
So that we might know  
What serves God's glory.  


== Love in the Body of Christ ==

We are members of each other, all of us comprising the whole body, so we should keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. But we must act out of love--if we don't act motivated out of love, it doesn't do any good; we could give everything away to all who are poor, or even give our lives away in martyrdom, but if someone's love is impure, "it would not help him a hair."

Verse 19  
Eph 4:1-4a I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit.

Let us seek to attain  
The unity of the Spirit,  
Undivided in belief  
As Paul said.  
Even the bond of peace  
Now and for all time  
Because we are all members  
Comprising one body. 

Verse 20  
O beloved brothers,  
And sisters together,  
Since we are all members  
Of one Body  
So let us prove faithful  
In Loving one another  
Thereby God is praised  
In His highest throne.  

Verse 21  
For He in all things  
Has commanded love.  
It is for that we strive  
Both early and late  
It will fulfill the Law  
As it is shown to us.  
Therefore, let us put on, with a will,  
The goodness of Jesus Christ.  

Verse 22  
1 Cor 13:3 Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 

If one gave away all his goods  
To the poor everywhere,  
And he also gave  
His body to be burned with fire,  
Were the love spoiled  
in his heart at all--  
He would lose everything;  
It would not help him a hair.  

== In conclusion ==

In conclusion, God requires nothing of us except that we obey this one great command: to love one another. If we are not loving one another (whom we can see), it is clear that we are incapable of loving God (whom we cannot see). 

The song ends with a prayer, that God would never forsake us in our present distress (remember, these are verses written in prison), or in future distresses (remember, many of these will be martyred). 

Love from the heart, the song ends, and it will make a way. If we truly desire love, from the heart, we can take courage and grasp love in its fulfill. 

Verse 23  
Then God requires nothing  
Of us, early and late  
But that we with diligence turn  
And keep His command.  
His command says to us,  
That we, at all times,  
Should love one another--  
This is pleasing to God.  

Verse 24  
Anyone who afflicts his neighbor  
Whom he sees all the time,  
How can he love God  
Whom he cannot see?  
You have have understood  
How one should love God.  
Then, hearken, all ye faithful,  
And keep love well.  

1 John 4:20 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen? 

Verse 25  
Our prayer that we bring  
Before Thee, O God most high:  
That Thou wouldst not forsake us  
Now or in any distress.  
Love in our hearts  
Will make a way.  
Whoever desires it from the heart  
will, with courage, grasp it.
