1 Corinthians 12:12-31a  

> 12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and we were all made to drink of one Spirit. 
>
> 14 Indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many. 15 If the foot would say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 16 And if the ear would say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many members, yet one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.” 22 On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23 and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect; 24 whereas our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member, 25 that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another. 26 If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it. 
27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. 28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers; then deeds of power, then gifts of healing, forms of assistance, forms of leadership, various kinds of tongues. 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles? 30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret? 31 But strive for the greater gifts.

We are in the second of three teachings on 1 Corinthians 12 and 13, asking what these passages can teach us about being good church members. Since this section explicitly uses the word "members," it's relatively easy, and Paul's message is clear. We are each given gifts to use for the good of the body as a whole, and we dare not either deny our gifts or think they are better than they are. Gifts: identify them, use them, don't deny them, don't flaunt them.

End of sermon.

Well, not quite.

## Marks ## 

One of the things that we want to think about, of course, as we become more and more of an official church is that we become more and more the kind of church that God wants us to be. Not surprisingly, people over the centuries have thought about this a lot. In the Reformed and Catholic traditions, one way they put this is to ask what the Marks of a True Church are. That is, what are the things that every church must have to be a real church? If you see these signs, or marks, then you know that it is a true church.

One of the ways I think about this is to think about walking into a church building and looking around and seeing if you can find these marks. If you see the marks, then you might want to be part of that church. And, if you see things that you don't like, but if the signs are still there, perhaps you should just shut your pie-hole and not complain.

So, what are these marks?

According to the Catholic church, there are four marks: that the church be "one, holy, catholic, and apostolic" church. It should be _one_: that is, part of the biggest church. It should be _holy_: dedicated to a holy life. It should be _catholic_: that is, everywhere, non-nationalistic, and accessible to all kinds of people. It should be _apostolic_, that is, able to trace its teachings and authority back to the apostles. 

According to the Reformed tradition, there are three marks: it should have _correct doctrine_: that is, rightly understanding the scriptures. It should _correctly administer the sacraments_, especially meaning communion and baptism. And it should _correctly administer discipline_, that is, admonish and correct church members who go wrong.

Both the Catholic church and the Reformed Church agree on the importance of going to the source of our beliefs and practices; the Reformed Churches go to the Bible, and the Catholic Churches to the apostles and their teaching; despite a difference in emphasis, these are the same thing. Of course, the Reformed churches and the Roman Catholic church disagree on what counts as part of that body of belief, and the Reformed attach (as well as the early Anabaptist attack) on the Roman Church was on its belief system, as well as its perceived _lack of_ holiness. And for the churches of the Reformation, it was more important to be _right_ (that is, to have correct doctrine) than to be _one_ (that is, be under the same organizational umbrella).


In thinking about all of these possible "marks of the church," I find myself somewhat conflicted. I do wish that those who call themselves Christians can be in unity in any number of ways, but know that unity is very difficult to achieve, and likely impossible in the short term. Does that mean there is no true church life going on?

I do wish that Christians would dedicate themselves to "holy living and holy dying," but have seen the brokenness of humanity over and over again spilling into the church. If the church is a hospital for the care of souls, we should even expect this there to be such brokenness. Jesus calls the sick, not the healthy, to himself, and if our illness sometimes affects the church, this should not surprise us. So, an "unhealthy" church might even be a "healthy" one. 

I do wish that the church were catholic in the sense of "universal," and (if you don't mind counting all the different denominational stances), the church does attract rich and poor, old and young, East and West. I am sickened, though, by the sad history of the relationships between the church and Jews--recall how important this was to Paul in our Romans study, and you'll see that a "catholic" church that doesn't somehow know how to include Jews in it is not universal; there is a dividing wall that was re-erected and doesn't look like it's coming down soon. Again, since this is a universal _lack_, I wonder if you can be a true mark.

I do wish that the church be pure in its doctrine, but I don't hold my breath that we will be able to agree on many important and substantive issues. Can we expect that only those who find the right formulations for (say) baptism, or universalism, or homosexuality, or peace issues be considered the true church? 

And I do wish the church be consistent and caring in its discipline. This is very difficult to do, of course, in the religiously pluralistic world we live in. People can always find a church that _will_ take them in, and, in our secular world, they don't even have to go to church. And, of course, the church has been buffeted over the past six decades or so in trying to decide what is worth disciplining. Various wrong beliefs? Divorce? Being gay? Accepting gays? And if we get it wrong (and it's likely that we will), are we no longer the true church? Many would say that the church has often been _overly_ harsh in its discipline.

You see the problem. The Roman Catholic Church, the Reformed churches, the Mennonite Church, the church down the street ... we'll all have problems of disunity, sin, racisms, sexism, and other "isms" (including anti-semitism), wrong doctrine, and badly administered discipline. Yet, at the end of the day, we say to Jesus, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You  have the words of eternal  life." (John 6:68)

## Gifts, not Marks? ##

So, now we can return to our passage. What does _this_ teach us about what a true church looks like? Now, this isn't a complete picture of the church, and Paul is responding to a specific question asked him, but even if it doesn't teach us all the marks, it teaches us an important mark of a true church: it's a church where the Spirit graces the people in it with gifts, and the people in it use those gifts for the upbuilding of the body. _Some_ of the people are teachers, apostles and prophets and are charged with focusing on true doctrine. _Some_ of the church have gifts that will lead people outside the church to belief, and so increase the universality of the church. _Some_ have gifts of administration, and so help us administer the sacraments and administer discipline. _Some_ have gifts of healing and assistance, _some_ for leading worship, and so help keep the church together and united. And we all are expected to work for the body's good.

As an important aside, I want to note that this will tend to grate on our own American individualism. We tend to ask what _we_ will get our of a particular church; well we be "fed"? Will it meet the needs of our children? Do we like the style? Will we be affirmed in our giftedness? But Paul's admonition is in the opposite direction: we need to ask how to use our gifts for the common good. 

In any case, a mark of a true church is that the gifts the Spirit gives the members are being used for the body. Maybe we could even say that we need to look for _gifts_ instead of _marks_.

## The all-volunteer church ## 

I think this is especially true in our particular local church. We are an all-volunteer church. No one makes any part of their living from being part of Kalamazoo Mennonite Church. We don't pay anyone to do the work of the church; we _must_ rely on the Spirit to give the strength and abilities we need. Maybe someday we won't be all-volunteer, and we can pay someone to do things for us. But maybe it's a gift that we have that we need to rely on God, and on one another, for what we need.

Consider how lunch comes together. How much I appreciate Bess's work in preparing the soup. But I also love to see how people quickly rally to get lunch on the table, the thought that CarolSue and others put into making bread, how people get the table set and cleared afterwards. This is both a good thing in itself, but it's also another metaphor or model for our life together. 

In our worship time, we rely on one another to read the scripture; a simple thing. We rely on one another to choose "psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs," which we do, more or less (although, I would encourage you again to consider tune selection outside of the meetings). We rely on one another during the teaching time, to express clarifications, disagreements, and additional insights.

In our prayers, we pray for one another. Bess has said she likes being part of a church in which she can pray for everyone every day, and I encourage you to consider that. 

But there may be other ways we can be a body together. Last night, we appreciated the way the Bruskis opened their house to us at various times, for example. I would love to hear additional ideas for whole-church activities and projects, and would encourage you, if God gives you leading, to bring ideas before us. Seriously, think about it! 

## Members of one another ##

This notion of our being the body of Christ (both locally, denominationally and globally) is a deep and profound one. But as said at the beginning, it's also a relatively easy idea too: We are each given gifts to use for the good of the body as a whole, and we dare not either deny our gifts or think they are better than they are. Gifts: identify them, use them, don't deny them, don't flaunt them.
