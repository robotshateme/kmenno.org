Luke 21:5-19
21:5 When some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God, he said,
   
21:6 "As for these things that you see, the days will come when not one stone will be left upon another; all will be thrown down."

21:7 They asked him, "Teacher, when will this be, and what will be the sign that this is about to take place?"

21:8 And he said, "Beware that you are not led astray; for many will come in my name and say, 'I am he!' and, 'The time is near!' Do not go after them.

21:9 "When you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must take place first, but the end will not follow immediately."

21:10 Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;

21:11 there will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and plagues; and there will be dreadful portents and great signs from heaven.

21:12 "But before all this occurs, they will arrest you and persecute you; they will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors because of my name.

21:13 This will give you an opportunity to testify.

21:14 So make up your minds not to prepare your defense in advance;

21:15 for I will give you words and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to withstand or contradict.

21:16 You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, by relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death.

21:17 You will be hated by all because of my name.

21:18 But not a hair of your head will perish.

21:19 By your endurance you will gain your souls.

## Tourists ##

Jesus and his disciples are in Jerusalem, and we know, but they don't, that this is the beginning of the end of their time together. Very soon, Jesus will be arrested, tried unfairly and killed. No longer will this tight-knitted group be together. But now they are simply in Jerusalem. They are rural people, and they are frankly gawking at what they see: the Temple, the center of religious life. They admire its beauty and its wealth, how well made it was. And, I think, they admired its power: this was not only a symbol of wealth and piety, but a symbol of the enduring nation of Israel. 

Now they knew, of course, that they were at the edge of another power: the power of the Roman empire. The temple was both protected and threatened by the power of Caesar and his government. And we know, but they don't, that this Roman   power will soon overthrow the power and wealth of Israel. In a few short decades, Rome will destroy the Temple. 

But Jesus knows this too: and he warns his disciples: not one stone will be left on another. The Temple will be utterly destroyed. 

Jesus doesn't have time to play the tourist. He desires to get in his last words and teachings to the disciples before he dies, and so he interrupts their pleasant gawkings with this harsh word.

## Disciples ##

The disciples, to their credit, understand they need to pay attention. They stop being tourists and start being disciples again: "Teacher," they asked, "When will these things take place, and what signs should we be looking for?"

And Jesus responds with a message which is both particular and universal. It's particular because he describes how Rome will surround Jerusalem and trample it. And this is just what happened in about the year 70. And Jesus also particularly describes the great split that will take place between his disciples and other Jews. And that too, happened: a great rift did occur, and the terrible history of Christian and Jewish antagonism began about the same time as the destruction of Jerusalem. 

But Jesus's message is also universal: What period of time has the world not been troubled by "wars and rumors of wars," with nations fighting each other, and natural and man-made disasters all around? When has it not been a difficult time to be a pregnant woman or new mother, vulnerable to all sorts and conditions of trouble and injury? 

## Witnesses ##

But Jesus gives promises inside this teaching: God is still in charge, though so much trouble will be everywhere. And the second promise is this: his followers will bear witness to God's faithfulness and to the words and work of Jesus despite the terrors that surround them. They will be forced to speak before kings and governments, but the spirit of Jesus will give them what they need to do so. They will be betrayed by people they love, but they will have the strength to bear it. They will be hated, and some of them will even be put to death, but (interestingly) not a hair of their head will perish. 

The disciples are simply following Jesus into Jerusalem, and very naturally, they start doing the tourist thing. But Jesus reminds them that there are powerful forces standing ready to compel them to do their bidding, and, despite this, they are to be witnesses to Jesus and his kingdom. 

## Temple ##

The disciples were distracted by the beauty, wealth, and power of the Temple, symbolic of the beauty, wealth, and power of the Jewish people. But Jesus reminds them that the Jewish nation existed at the edge of this other, greater power: the wealth and power of Rome, that would soon destroy the Jews' outward symbols of power, wealth, and beauty. And Jesus warns them that this destructive power will soon come, and that, in the last gasps of Jewish power, the newly forming Christian community will be hurt. Sadly, of course, we know the newly forming Christian church struck back, with terrible consequences up to the current time.

But Jesus extends promises to them, and gives them a new role: to bear witness. 

## American Power ##

We, too, are Jesus's disciples. And we, too, can be easily distracted by the beauty, wealth and power around us. Really, the power of Rome is nothing compared to the power of the American state and the power of the American economy and culture. Our military power extends far beyond what the Romans achieved. A person sitting in an office in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. can control a drone aircraft that can rain down hellish destruction at points thousands of miles away. Even more so, our military power literally has the power to kill every single person in the world. Our economic and cultural power effects nearly every person on earth. There are people toiling in a factory in China to produce tee-shirts with the face of some sexy American pop star on it, that will shipped to the US, sold to us in Walmart, worn and then donated to charity, and will end up on a child somewhere in Africa. And it's easy to be like those early disciples and just be tourists who admire and stand in awe of this power, wealth and beauty.

But Jesus, I think, seeks to pull us up short: our beauty, wealth, and power is temporary and fragile. And, in our current economy, this is easy to feel. Our economy is a marvel, but so many of us are without jobs, and the goods and services offered to us feel empty. Often, the cultural effects we have on others feels more like an infection. Despite the unimaginable destructive power of our weapons, we seem unable to win wars. The conduct of the war, with torture such as waterboarding commonplace and justified at the highest levels, degrades our standing as a nation founded as "a city on a hill." And we are dimly aware that another great power, China, just might take our place.

## Disciples and Witnesses in the face of Power ##

So Jesus continues to call us to be disciples, and he calls us to be witnesses. Our small, fragile community at Kalamazoo Mennonite, and the other Christian communities which we represent, are not to be distracted by the power, wealth and beauty around us, nor are we to be frightened by it. We are to go about our business of being and becoming God's people. 

What will this mean for us? At times, this means following the sign they used to put up in Britain during World War 2: "Keep Calm and Carry On." We carry on with the call we have, to love another another, do our jobs well, be faithful in the use and disposal of the wealth and power we personally possess. 

I wonder, though, if some of us might lead the way in stretching us in what it means to be witnesses in the presence of power: to "speak truth to power," as the Quakers and others say. I ask you to consider this: are there ways our fellowship, or the fellowship you are part of, should be a more active witness? Now, it may be, like those early disciples, we won't have any choice: we'll be swept away and put upon by the earthly powers and we will find ourselves witnesses in different places than we would choose for ourselves. But perhaps the Spirit is prompting you to take some steps that can help us be better disciples and witnesses; let me suggest that this be something for you to consider and meditate on this week.
