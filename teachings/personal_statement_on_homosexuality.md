Personal statement on homosexuality 

Our sexual nature is part of our unfallen human nature [Gen 1:27], but like every aspect of human nature, has been subject to the degradation of sin [Rom 6:23]. Through the power of the Spirit [John 14:15] and the cross [Eph 2:16], a new humanity is being created [Gen 17:5, Gal 3:14] that will restore and more than restore our intimate relationship with God and one another. This will not fully accomplished in this life [1 Cor 13:12]; our reconciliation and healing is both "now" [Rom 5:11]  and "not yet" [Rev 22:2].

We live in a sin-soaked culture, which is both the consequence and cause of our estrangement with God [Rom 1:18-32]. The sexual social revolution of the past fifty years has had much to commend to it, but, as with all aspects of human culture, it, too, is partial, broken, wrong, or evil on many levels. 

Scripture seems to consider sexual sin on par with most other kinds of sin--no worse, but certainly no better--than other items in lists of sin in the scripture [eg. Gal 3:19-21] (with the exception of not giving God the proper glory due God [Rom 1:21-24]).

Scripture presents the ideal human family as a man and a woman becoming one flesh [Gen 1:27; Gen 2:24-25] and for the propagation of humanity and the nurture of the earth [Gen 2:28-31; Mk 10:4-9]. The church has struggled over the ages to understand how to respond to failures to achieve this ideal.  For example, church has, to my knowledge, never considered a marriage invalid if no children are produce (although, at times, it has certainly allowed annulment in such cases. The church has struggled quite a bit with the question of divorce, especially because of the teachings of Jesus on this matter [Mat 5:32; Mk 10:4-5]. The Mennonite church's "Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective" admits (in its commentary) that "some in the church experience divorce, abuse, sexual misconduct, and other problems that make marriage and family life burdensome or even impossible." In this admission, we recognize the inability of all to live this ideal.
