## Association and Fellowship ##

We continue the process of becoming a "normal" church, with a constitution, a leadership structure, and explicit categories of membership. We have our "constitutional convention" next week, that spells out some of the rights and responsibilities we might have as members of Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship, and so I am very grateful to God that the epistle readings from the lectionary for the next few weeks are from Paul's first letter to the Corintians in which Paul explicitly touches on some of these very topics. 

When we become members of a club or association, we typically have certain "rights and responsibilities" that come with it. I'm a member of the Delta Frequent Flyer Club. My rights include carrying around a little gold card with my personal name on it, occasional upgrades, and free luggage check-in. My responsibilities include flying with Delta and handing them lots of cash (well, technically, my company's cash). I used to be a member of the YMCA, and my rights included the ability to get a hot shower, use of their facilities, and a place to store my gym clothes. My responsibilities included handing them lots of cash. Unfortunately, it wasn't my _responsibility_ to use the facilities; otherwise I might be in better shape physically.

In this way, Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship is like any other club or association. You come to the club, pay your dues, you get certain things, and you give certain things.

But when Paul talks here about what membership means, he doesn't use the kind of language one associates with clubs or associations. He talks about the Spirit and about gifts, he talks about the Body, and he talks about love. We'll be looking at these over the next few weeks, as I said, but we'll want to keep all of these in mind.

It seems clear that in verse 1, Paul is turning to a new topic. "Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed." (Paul actually says something like, "Now concerning spirituals", but he probably means spiritual gifts or spirit-filled people, or things given by the Spirit.)  Paul goes on to say, 

> You know that when you were pagans, you were enticed and led astray to idols that could not speak. 3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says “Let Jesus be cursed!” and no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit. 

There appears to be a lot of background information here that we are not privy too. But I read it as something like this. Before they became Christians, some of the Corinthian brothers and sisters were involved in other religions, and, as part of their experience, they would be involved in various ecstatic practices in which the voices of their so-called gods would speak through them. It was something like that. In any case, they would bring their previous practice and expectations into their Christian experience. And one thing that happened was that people were going into trance states (or something like that) and shouting out things. None of this would have been surprising to them, or to Paul. They expected the Spirit to be active in their life together and their worship together.

Some of them were shouting "Jesus is Lord." But some of them were shouting a very peculiar thing: "Let Jesus be cursed!" Perhaps the Corinthian church was asking Paul what that was all about. Why would the Spirit say that? What could it mean? What did Paul think?

Of course, Paul doesn't think very much of it. He sees it as conforming to the pattern of the old ways of doing things: this is what the pagans do, listening to whatever things people in ecstasy say and believing it. He's very clear: when people talk like this, they aren't talking for God. Instead, Paul expects the Spirit to speak in a different way: to exalt Jesus and his Lordship, to remind people of their need to be obedient to Jesus, to be comforted by the thought of his power, to be warned about the Lord who someday would come into power--all of the images that Paul and others draw out about Jesus as Lord.

So, this a clear enough, and a good and even practical rule to follow: If a particular church or worship practice tends to extend Jesus's Lordship, then we can affirm that the Spirit is moving; if it tends to deny  Jesus's Lordship, let's just not do that, ok? 

But it's not as if the Spirit is uninvolved in the life of the church. On the contrary, it is the Spirit who gives the church the gifts, the "charismata," the "chrisms", the "graces," that the church requires. In Paul's words:

> Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. ... All these [gifts] are activated by one and the same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as the Spirit chooses.   

When we have been asked about the "vision" we have for Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship, I have always said that we don't have a particular vision for what the church looks like. We meet in a house not because we have a great vision for house churches; we don't have a paid staff not because we have a great vision for a new way of doing ministry; our worship is the way it is not because we have a great vision for a capella music, and so on. We are just trying to pay attention to the Spirit's leading, and we don't yet discern a grand plan or vision for ourselves. 

But there is at least one thing I believe in very strongly in with respect to our fellowship. I believe the Bible says that the Spirit gives the church the gifts it needs. One important implication is that, if we need some gift, God will provide it. If we need to grow bigger, God will grant this; if we need more music, God will grant this. And, when people do arrive, one of the questions we can ask ourselves about them is what gifts are God sending us through them. 

## Gifts of speaking ##

Now, let's talk a little about the specific gifts mentioned here. It is clear that Paul is not giving an exhaustive list. Firstly, in other letters, and even in this same section, Paul gives other lists which overlap with this one. Secondly, we have already seen that Paul is responding to a specific question about "the spirituals," and there's some background about which we cannot be 100% sure--but it has something to do with prophetic or ecstatic statements being made. It seems to me that the gifts he describes are largely in response to that--he affirms the validity of gifts of supernatural speaking--special tongues, special wisdom, special knowledge, prophecy--but also affirms the importance of a gift of discernment about what is said. For surely it is important to be discerning about what is spoken, and special speaking may require special discernment. 

Too often, people are asked to believe things just because the speaker says that God has given them some insight directly. But special messages must be specially tested. For example (and I think I've told this story before), one time at worship at a previous church I was feeling very low, very depressed; it was, I think, one my periods of doubt. As I sat there, one of the brothers who had a reputation as a prophet came up to me and said that God had told him that I was sad and that he should talk to me. I was angry enough that I wanted to hit him--the gall to think that it took some special revelation from God to note what was plain on my face! 

The thing is, if he had come up and simply asked me if I were sad or what I was sad about, I might have welcomed his presence. Perhaps God _had_ spoken to him directly about me, but the message this brother delivered (as I perceived it) was more about him than about me.

The point, then, is that God does and will speak to the church as it gathers in various ways--messages which must be interpreted and filtered through discerning ears. Even more important is these and other gifts that God gives the church are just that: _gifts_, and they are given by the Holy Spirit to build up the church. 

## Being glad for the gifts God has given ##

Look around and be glad for the gifts God has given. How God has graced us with these people! And with those who cannot make it today!

I know our church needs prayer, because God has given us Barb. I know that we need hospitality because God has given us Bess and her soup. I know that we need youthful energy, because God has given us Jane and Isaac. I know that we need to think outside these walls, so God has given us Harold and Carolyn and the Villages. I know we need blessing and a pastoral heart, because God has given us CarolSue. And so on! 

By the way, I think there is something that God wants to do among us about just and simple living. I don't quite know what it is, but I'm glad for the Bylers and the Van Heests who seem to stir up these thoughts in me. 

## Communion ##

As we go into our communion service, we remember that God gives us many kinds of gifts. We are grateful for the gift of bread and wine to remind us of God's greatest gift to us--Christ's death and resurrection.
