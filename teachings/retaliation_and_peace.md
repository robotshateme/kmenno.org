Mt 5.33—48
38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ 39 But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; 40 and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well; 41 and if anyone forces you to go one mile, go also the second mile. 42 Give to everyone who begs from you, and do not refuse anyone who wants to borrow from you. 

43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, 45 so that you may be children of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the righteous and on the unrighteous. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet only your brothers and sisters,​what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? 48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. 

Luke 6:27-35

27 “But I say to you that listen, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, 28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. 29 If anyone strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also; and from anyone who takes away your coat do not withhold even your shirt. 30 Give to everyone who begs from you; and if anyone takes away your goods, do not ask for them again. 31 Do to others as you would have them do to you. 

32 “If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. 33 If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same. 34 If you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much again. 35 But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return.​e​ Your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. 36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.    

Exodus 21:23-25
23 If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. 

Lev 19:17-19
17 You shall not hate in your heart anyone of your kin; you shall reprove your neighbor, or you will incur guilt yourself. 18 You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against any of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.

Lev. 24:17-22
17 Anyone who kills a human being shall be put to death. 18 Anyone who kills an animal shall make restitution for it, life for life. 19 Anyone who maims another shall suffer the same injury in return: 20 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; the injury inflicted is the injury to be suffered. 21 One who kills an animal shall make restitution for it; but one who kills a human being shall be put to death. 22 You shall have one law for the alien and for the citizen: for I am the Lord your God. 
 
Det 19:21
21 Show no pity: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. 

Proverbs 24:28-29
28 Do not be a witness against your neighbor without cause, 
and do not deceive with your lips. 
29 Do not say, “I will do to others as they have done to me; 
I will pay them back for what they have done.” 

Rom 12:17-21
17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil, but take thought for what is noble in the sight of all. 18 If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. 19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of God;​for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” 20 No, “if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them something to drink; for by doing this you will heap burning coals on their heads.” 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. 

1 Thess 5:15
15 See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all.


- Play IPD (5,3,1,0)

- Introduce tit-for-tat
- 'eye for an eye' is negative tit-for-tat
- best way to live? 
  - note: this is a _community_ rule
  - note: this _limits_ payback, and _requires_ payback (Det 19:21)
  
Two new games:

- "Safe IPD": DC>CC>DD>CD but CD is "large enough". servings of soup and dessert.  (5,4,3,2)

  - If you both cooperate, you get up to 4. eg 2 bowls of soup + 2 dessert
  - If you both defect, you get up to 3. 2 soup + dessert
  - If one defects, the other cooperates, defector gets up to 5. 2 soups, 2 desserts, cooperator gets up to 2: 1 soup + 1 dessert
  
Claim: Best to cooperate, you'll always get enough in this generous world. Even more so if, if both defect, you'd get no choices at all.

- "Super rich" IPD. One of the players has a billion dollars. And the other player has almost nothing. Imagine your the super-rich player. Will you defect? Maybe (because that's how you got your billion in the first place). But maybe not: no marginal benefit, but gain 'social capital'. 

- "Poor" IPD. Imagine you're the poor person in this game, and the only way for you to survive is if you both cooperate. (If you both cooperate, eg, you both get food, but the rich guy can buy his own food.)

I think Jesus's original teachings apply mostly in something like the this case. The "super-rich" are the powerful religious leaders and the Roman empire.

- Do not resist. If you resist a Roman soldier (who has lots of weaponry), you will get hurt. If you don't resist, at least you won't get hurt.
- Give your cloak as well. Go the second mile. Perhaps you can call out to the 'super rich' or super powerful by showing your poverty and weakness to gain his/her cooperation. 
- Give to those that beg and want to borrow. ??? 

BUT ALSO, there is a God watching you 'play the game.' And we are called to be God-like. In Matthew, we are called to "be perfect," just like God. In Luke, we are called to "be merciful," just like God.

Review the beatitudes with this in mind: 

poor (in spirit): unable to use power to retaliate
mourn: sad for the injury caused them
meek: unwilling to take on the powers
hunger & thirst: care more about what God wants than what is in for them
merciful: willing to not revenge
peacemakers: change the game
persecuted: people will call you stupid if you do this
