Judges 4

Is this one of the saddest verses in the Bible? "In those days, there was no king in Israel; all the people did what was right in their own eyes." (Judges 21:25)

After the death of Joshua, "The Lord raised up judges who delivered [the people of Israel] out of the power of those who plundered them" (Judges 2:16)

The stories in the book of Judges follow a well known pattern, pretty much a simple program:

    10 The people do evil in the site of the Lord (usually worshiping other gods)
    20 God raises up enemies
    30 The people cry out to God
    40 God sends a judge who delivers the people
    50 The people follow God for a while
    60 GOTO 10

Deborah is the fourth in the series. She was renown for her wisdom. She would hold court and all of Israel would come for judgment. Of course, this is very unusual for a woman to do. She also told Barak to fight against Sisera, the general of the Canaanite army which was oppressing them. Barak insisted that Deborah accompany them. She agreed, but said the glory of the battle would go to a woman. Barak's troops defeated the Canaanites. Sisera fled and went to the tent of a woman named Jael. She was a Kenite, who were allies of the Canaanites. Sisera asked her for protection, which she promised. She gave him food and drink and a place to sleep. And then she drove a tent peg through his head. 

> “Most blessed of women be Jael,
>   the wife of Heber the Kenite,
>   of tent-dwelling women most blessed.
> He asked water and she gave him milk,
>   she brought him curds in a lordly bowl.
> She put her hand to the tent peg
>   and her right hand to the workmen’s mallet;
>   she struck Sisera a blow,
>   she crushed his head,
>   she shattered and pierced his temple.
> He sank, he fell,
>   he lay still at her feet;
>   at her feet he sank, he fell;
>   where he sank, there he fell dead.

Why don't we sing that song more often?

We get two conflicting morals from these stories:

1. Deborah and Jael are rare stories of women, and they are praised for their wisdom and initiative. Therefore, especially with Deborah, we see that God calls women as well as men into leadership. 
2. Deborah and Jael show how God uses violence to deliver Israel. Therefore, there is a kind of holy violence acceptable when God is the deliverer.

We Mennonites usually affirm the former – men and women are both called to leadership, but deny the later – that there is a holy violence which we can or even should participate in. 

How can this be?

Briefly and imperfectly, we understand this to be due to the unfolding history of salvation. 

1. Human life begins "in a garden" where God and people and nature are all at peace.
2. But humanity falls, into a denial and even hatred of God, and a denial and hatred of other people.
3. And now there's been a long journey of God rebuilding a people for himself:

- God calls Abraham to live by faith,
- God provides the law to Moses and delivers Israel,
- God calls judges and kings to create a geopolitical nation that worships God,
- God remains with the people even as they go into exile
- God sends prophets with messages of justice, mercy, and righteousness, and a promise of a coming Messiah,
- God sends the Son, Jesus, who teaches a new kingdom of righteousness and peace, and who dies on behalf of Israel and the whole world

4. God calls a new people into being. In God's non-geopolitical kingdom, "there is neither Jew nor Greek, male nor female, slave nor free" for we all all one in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:28). Anyone can be part of that kingdom through God's provision. 

So, things have changed! 

- God no longer is concerned with a nation-state
- God's only "nation" is the church
- The church conquers its enemies through love (or dies trying)
- In the church, our status is determined by being in Christ Jesus, not through our nationality, gender or citizen status

Of course, we see hints in this story. God uses the weak (so-called) to deliver the nation. But its fulness is in Christ Jesus. Our weapons, as the verse from 1 Thessalonians 5:8 in our lectionary passage says, are weapons of faith, love, and the hope of salvation; not the weapons of war. 

So:

- May you have the wisdom of Deborah without the state-sanctioned violence she showed
- May you have the courage of Jael without the personal betrayal and personal violence she showed
- Overcome your enemies with love, understanding that not everyone will have the capacity to receive that gift. But you are being changed from glory to glory.
- This is not humanly possible, but only through the protection of God through faith and Jesus and the power of the Spirit
