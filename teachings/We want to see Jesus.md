## We want to see Jesus ##

> Now among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.” Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus. Jesus answered them, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. Very truly, I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains just a single grain; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. Those who love their life lose it, and those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me, and where I am, there will my servant be also. Whoever serves me, the Father will honor.

> “Now my soul is troubled. And what should I say—‘Father, save me from this hour’? No, it is for this reason that I have come to this hour. Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” The crowd standing there heard it and said that it was thunder. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.” Jesus answered, “This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.” He said this to indicate the kind of death he was to die. (NRSV)


This passage starts out simple enough. We are in Jerusalem, and the great Passover festival is about to begin. Jews from all over have come to celebrate. And included in the throng are some Greek-speaking people, who might have been Greek-speaking Jews or Greek-speaking "God-fearers" who admired the Jews. Amidst the hubbub of the crowds coming into Jerusalem, they heard about Jesus. In fact, how could they not? He'd raised Lazarus from the dead! A great crowd had shouted Hosanna as he rode, both royally and humbly, into Jerusalem.

And these Greeks seek a personal interview with Jesus, so they use their connections: they talk to Philip, who talks to Andrew, and they together come to talk to Jesus, to make an introduction -- much as, if you remember, Andrew and Peter and Nathaniel and Philip were originally introduced to Jesus. The passage is a little unclear, but I think Philip and Andrew bring these Greeks with them so they can meet Jesus.

I said the Greeks wanted to meet Jesus, but what the passage says is they wanted to "see Jesus." And this, too, calls back to the first chapter, in which the disciples are told to "come and see." 

What is especially important is what the Greeks and the overhearing disciples are told they are going to see.

They are going to see the Son of Man be glorified. They won't just see him; they'll see his glory. Their simple wish to "see Jesus" starts them on a path to behold the glory of the Son of Man.

As Christians after the resurrection, we can't help but think this is the glory to which Jesus is referring: how the disciples beheld the risen Lord. We can't help it, for he mentions his death. He will be a grain of wheat that is scattered and falls into the earth. And he says he will be "lifted up from the earth" -- the same image he used when talking to Nicodemus in our passage from last week -- he will be lifted up on the cross. And so of course we think of the resurrection, and rightly so. Grains of wheat "die" and then come to life again.

But what I find fascinating is that Jesus does not here directly refer to the fruit of the resurrection (as he does in other places as John records in his gospel). Rather the fruit seems to be three different things:

1. The flourishing of the enlightened community
2. The judgment of the world
3. The driving out of the ruler of this world

Let's take these in reverse order.

### The driving out of the ruler of this world ###

When Jesus says, "now, the ruler of this world will be driven out," to whom is he referring? I think there is little doubt that he is referring to the devil and his ruling powers. 

How does the ruler of this world rule? Is it not through fear? And what is it that is feared most? Is it not death? 

The way of Jesus is the way of death: he faces it bravely and forthrightly. He asks if he should ask the Father to save him from the hour of tortuous death he knows he faces. And he answers himself: No, because this is the very reason he has come, and it is the way to glory.

Death is the entrance for the light of God's glory to drive out the ruler of this world, and the devil's fearful shadow.

### The judgment of the world ###

Jesus says, "Now is the judgment of this world." What does he mean? This moment is "the still point of the turning world": As T.S. Eliot writes:

> Neither flesh nor fleshless;   
> Neither from nor towards; ...   
> But neither arrest nor movement. ...   
> Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,   
> Neither ascent nor decline.   

This moment is the fixed point of all history.

Once again, we hear a voice from heaven: "I have gloried my name, and I will glorify it again." Past and present combine. Some people hear just thunder. Some people know it's some spiritual, angelic thing. And some hear it as the voice of the Father. And so we are judged: to some, the presence of the glory of God will be a painful clash. But to some it comes as a delight, and a promise of even greater union with God.

### The flourishing of the enlightened community ###

To some, the glory comes to enlighten them, and we -- for I hope to include myself among them -- we reflect the glory back to God. 

Jesus offers a choice: on the one hand, to love this present life and all of its pleasures and finitude, on the other (and these are harsh words, I know it), to hate this present life, with all its pleasures and finitude.

He is the first to die. He is the first grain of wheat. But what grows? What is the fruit? An enlightened community that serves Jesus, that follow him. And where he is going is the way of death, of self-sacrificial love. 

And for those who do? Not just a finite life, but an eternal one. Not a judgment from God, but honor from God. Not a meaningless life, but knowing that we are part of the great movement of God, bringing the good news to a new generation of people.

### Will you follow? ###

Will you follow Jesus? Will you follow him when it is easy, and when it is hard? Will you take courage from the fact that, when it is hard, when you die your small deaths and big ones, God can use that for life? Can you point others to Jesus on the cross, pointing him out as John the Baptist did, as Andrew and Philip did?

If you do, God promises _you_ life, and honor. It is not an easy way at times. But we know that Jesus is the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.
