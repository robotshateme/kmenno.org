## Unity under the cross ##
1 Corinthians 1:18-28

What is the basic message of 1 Corinthians 1:18-28? 

Is it that _wisdom_ is a bad thing? No, it's puffed-up wisdom, "the wisdom of the world" and "the debater of this age" who comes off badly. Paul contrasts God's wisdom with human wisdom. 

Paul makes four points:

1. God said he would destroy a kind of wisdom (1:19, a quote from the Greek version of Isaiah 29:14)
2. Worldly wisdom is not sufficient to know God
3. A common-sense argument: not many of the people in the church are very wise by human ("fleshly") standards, God chose us and not the wise ones
4. God chose to save people through the proclamation of the cross. In God's work on the cross, God demonstrated both his power (the resurrection) through weakness (Jesus's death), and his wisdom in that what seemed like foolishness (a dying God) is true wisdom (the resurrection)

In addition, we need to note _the context_ of this passage. Look at that first word: "for". Paul is continuing an argument. 

What is that argument?

That some people are dividing up the church by how they came to be Christians, either "Paul's people" or "Apollos's people" or "Christ's people". It wasn't Paul or Apollos's wisdom that brought them to Christ, but the proclamation of the good news in the cross.

Paul desires that "all of you be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose." 

And specifically this idea of division by origin. Good thing this has died out. We'd never name a church group after a person ...

By the way, it chapter 2, Paul does say that wisdom comes with maturity, as we achieve the mind of Christ. Which he also talks about in Ephesians. He also first talks about spiritual _gifts_ (v 14) for the first time in the letter, which he will make so much of. 

Paul calls us to "be in agreement and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same purpose."

I think by this he cannot mean total agreement on matters of belief or no sub-groups.

He recognizes elders, deacons, widows, Greeks and Jews, men and women, slave and masters. He also allows at least a door for different understandings.

What can we make of this? Is Paul being inconsistent? By no means. We are not all the _same_, but we are all united _under the proclaimed cross_. And are all united in our _weakness_ before God.

What can this mean for us?

- It may be a partial answer to why we have so many denominations, and why that might not be such a terrible thing. If we realize that we are united in our weakness under the cross. Has God abandoned the church to Satan?
- If we think we "have the answer," we need to hold that conviction lightly and humbly
  - that could be things of incredible importance to us, that we cannot give up (our peace witness, our beliefs about how Scripture works, our beliefs about the roles of men and women, the role of Mary, and on and on)
  - especially when that relates to others in the church who are also under the cross
- We should pray for unity (Ellie and Allan Krieder's essay)
