"Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Mt 5:48)

What are the general lessons we learn from Matthew 5:13-48?

- God wants us to be perfect. 

Jesus calls his followers "the salt of the earth" (5:13). By this, he doesn't mean we are good, solid citizens, but the the thing that preserves and protects the earth. He calls us "the light of the world," and "a city build on hill," that provides the light the world needs to see by; something so obvious that it cannot be hidden.

Jesus further says that God provided his Law; and that he came to fulfill it. That is, the Law is central to his plan to instruct us in perfection.

- God knows that we are not perfect.

In the background to much of what Jesus is saying is an acknowledgement that we are _not_ perfect, even if we are the to be salt and light of the world. In particular, Jesus points out that _external_ standards of perfection, as important as they are, are not good enough. God knows our angry hearts, not just when we murder. God knows our lustful hearts, not just when we commit adultery. God knows our real intentions when we speak and make vows, not just the words we utter. 

- God wants us to know that we are not perfect.

And of course, Jesus speaks these things so that we become more aware that we are not perfect. We know our own hearts and the anger and lusts therein. We know how are twisting our own words to make people believe what we want them to believe.  

- God wants us to want to be perfect. 

There are a number of ways Jesus could have done this teaching. He could have just focused on the bad news, that we are not perfect, as both the Law and our own hearts then teach us. But time and time again he gives us positive commands. Of course, he directly says, "Be perfect, as perfect as God!"  But he gives us specific explanations of how God's plan is to be worked out. For example, if we are in the middle of worship, and we become aware that someone has reason to against us, we are to leave off worship and get reconciled. We understand this especially in the context of communion -- it's not just about our relationship between God and ourselves, but also among ourselves. We prepare for communion by asking ourselves if we have any "business" to take care of.

- Jesus came to make us perfect. 

I don't think Jesus gives us these commands just to make us feel bad, to feel our lack and need. He came to make us perfect, to become the city on the hill. He wants us to _become_ perfect and follow in his way. And so we are all on a journey for perfection, and Jesus is the one who makes the journey possible. Not so much in this passage, but a lot of the rest of the New Testament witness tells us that Jesus's death and resurrection release us from the death of sin and hell. Jesus sends his Spirit to empower us to grow in obedience to his perfect Law. Jesus provides the "means of grace," including his teaching, the loving community, music, and communion to help us on our way.

- The open door

Jesus says that unless our righteousness exceeds the righteousness of even those we call righteous, we will not enter God's kingdom. The door to the kingdom, therefore, cannot be passed through on our own, but Jesus stands at the door, inviting us through, where we enter on a life-long journey to become as perfect as God. God wants you to be perfect. Do you want to be perfect? Do you understand you are not? Do you believe is the one who came to make us perfect? Jesus invites us in.
