## The passage

Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. *Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly.* But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”

All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet: “Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel,” which means, “God is with us.”

When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son; and he named him Jesus. (Matthew 1:18-25)

## The decision of Joseph

I don't envy Joseph in the days after he found out that his beloved fiancée, Mary, was pregnant. I like how the Scripture is a bit coy in describing this: She “was found to be with child.” We can all imagine what this would have been like, for a young woman like Mary to be pregnant by someone not her husband, not even her fiancé. The whispers, the looks...

Last week, we saw Mary's response, which was full of grace. She came to see this pregnancy as a great gift. We heard her response of adoration that God would look at her, in her lowliness, to bear God's Christ child. She was so glad to know that God remembered God's promises to deliver the people of Israel from their oppression, and that she was to play a part in that.

That was Mary, and and at this point in the story, Joseph doesn't seem to know any of this.

Here's what he knows: the young woman he was going to marry is pregnant. Perhaps he knows what she believes happened; perhaps not. I'm not sure it would make a difference.

And so he faces a decision: what is he going to do in face of this radical change in his plans?

Before we get into that, I want you to remember times in your own lives when you thought you knew what was going to happen, but things got upended in some way. I remember the time when Bess and I decided to move to New Brunswick, Canada, and I went ahead to start the job, while Bess stayed back and sold the house. But when I got there, worked a while, and received my first paycheck, and I realized that there was *no way* we were going to be able to live on the take-home pay, especially when it looked like it was going to be a lot harder for Bess to get a job in Canada than we thought. I am sure we all have our stories about how life upends us, and we then face hard decisions, decisions that often have long-lasting consequences for our lives and the lives of others.

Joseph was in such a place. He was ready to marry, start a family, and live the normal life of a first century peasant carpenter. But his fiancée “is found to be pregnant.”

On the one hand, Joseph was a righteous man. He knew what was right, and was wrong. He knew the rules about sex and marriage and pregnancy. I don't think it was the rumors and whispers that affected Joseph so much as the *wrongness* he perceived. It looked like Mary had made a very bad decision, and he wanted to do the right thing. "You shall not commit adultery" (which included sexual relations before marriage) was one of the most basic laws of Israel. The Mosaic law even allowed stoning of adulterers; as we read in the story of the woman caught in adultery, this stoning seems to have survived as a practice.

On the other hand, Joseph had, I believe, kind feelings towards Mary. He might have been angry, but he doesn't want to see her killed!

What did he decide? The Scriptures tell us: *Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly.*

Joseph was righteous, and so he could not live with her. But he was unwilling to see her publicly disgraced, so he decided to “dismiss her quietly.” In other words, the engagement contract was broken when she became pregnant; it no longer was binding on him. So, he was just going to walk away from it, but not make a fuss that would disgrace her.

We have been looking at the notion of "grace" during Advent, and so that word "disgrace" jumped out at me. "Joseph was unwilling to expose her to public disgrace". Sometimes, we understand words and concept from their opposites, so I'm glad it shows up here! Again, imagine the disgrace that an engaged young woman found to be pregnant by someone not her fiancé would be expected to feel! Everyone would be sending the message: *bad, bad, Mary you are bad*.

And Joseph wants to spare Mary from as much as possible, so he decides to do things as quietly as possible. Sending young pregnant girls off to their aunt’s in another town has a long tradition, and perhaps this is what Joseph was thinking to do.

So, I think we can learn a little bit about grace from Joseph's example. Grace is protection from the messages of shame that might come towards us. Grace is the absence of disgrace.

But *there is so much more to grace than this.*

In fact, the word “disgrace” doesn't even appear in the Greek version of Matthew's story; interestingly, the King James Version does a better job of translation here. It says merely, “Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example...” Exposing Mary publicly would have certainly disgraced her, so our pew translations are fine, I think.

Joseph is doing the best he is capable of. He is trying to be good; he is trying to be kind.

What he doesn't know is how God is intervening in the story. It takes an angel appearing to him to let him know that greater things are afoot here. Mary's pregnancy is from the Holy Spirit. Mary's child, whom he is to raise with her, will be the looked-for Savior, Messiah, Jesus.

And I think this something I learn about grace in this story. You do the best you can, you be as good and as loving as you can, and you will find yourself in the midst of God's overarching story of pouring out grace to the world.

I am thinking of a friend of mine. As I am writing this, she is driving through the snow and rain to another state to be at the bedside of her mother, who had a stroke on Friday. The prognosis is unknown, but not good. It's been a bit of a roller-coaster for my friend, emotionally. She is torn between wanting her mother to recover and wanting her mother not to suffer. Like Joseph, she strives to be a righteous person, a good person. She is doing the best she can. God be thanked, I believe the "best she can" is pretty good because she had striven to follow God's way, to become wiser in dealing with her mother, her family, her own emotions and reactions. Like Joseph, not perfect, of course.

But what I am convinced of is this: my friend is embedded in the big story of God's grace in the world. She is called to do the best she can. After all, how could she do *better* than her best? But God' grace undergirds her, grace surrounds her, grace goes before her.

But of course, this is true for each of us! Sometimes we see this in times of crisis, like my friend's. Sometimes, it seems most absent in this moments. We can hope for a shot of insight, like that given to Joseph in the dream. But the story that began to reach its climax in the pregnancy of Mary, the faithfulness of Joseph, and the birth of that Christ child is the same story of grace that undergirds *us*, surrounds *us*, goes before *us*.

May this be of comfort and joy to you this morning.
