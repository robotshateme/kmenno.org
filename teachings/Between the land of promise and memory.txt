Between the lands of promise and memory
- Dt 26:1-11
- A "historical reenactment" of Moses speaking to the people just
  before they are to enter the promised land
- Standing at a key moment looking a their future, and looking at their
  past
- Their future
    - a land that they will possess — note the sequence, 'an
      inheritance to possess, you possess, and settle in it'
        - an inheritance — a promise they have been given
        - possess — coming into the land
        - settle in it — they settle down and 'get comfortable'
- A ceremony they were to fulfill, giving "the first fruits"
    - so settled that even God has a house there :)
    - a priest and a yearly practice
    - The ceremony
        - gather the first fruits
        - put it in a basket
        - give to priest
        - recite a history
        - bow before the Lord
        - have a party ('you' that is the families, the Levites, and
          aliens)
- Their past
    - "A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went down into Egypt and
      lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he became a
      great nation, mighty and populous. 6 When the Egyptians treated
      us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labor on us, 7 we
      cried to the Lord, the God of our ancestors; the Lord heard our
      voice and saw our affliction, our toil, and our oppression. 8 The
      Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and an
      outstretched arm, with a terrifying display of power, and with
      signs and wonders; 9 and he brought us into this place and gave
      us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. "
    - Who was the wandering Aramean? (I've been getting this wrong for
      years!)
        - It is Jacob who wandered into the land of Aram (present day
          Syria) and worked for years to marry Rachel and Leah — a life
          full of surprises
    - What is this history?
        - Went from a small group to a mighty nation
        - Went from a secure family to an oppressed minority
        - But they are to remember that "The Lord brought us out of
          Egypt with a mighty hand"
- What is the significance of this ceremony?
    - When things are going well or you are 'settled' or even 'too
      settled'
        - remember God is with you and brought you to where you are.
          You were once not in a good situation, but now you are.
        - remember that things can change at a moment's notice — or
          even a slow decline
        - remember to celebrate and share with 'the alien' that is,
          people not like you, those for whom things are not going so
          well. (also, invite your local Levite – I think that's
          CarolSue and me :)
    - When things are going badly, or you are 'unsettled'
        - remember that God has always been a God of sojourners and
          wanderers
        - remember God is with you
            - that God will hear your cry
            - God will be with you and make a strong difference in your
              life (maybe with real fireworks, maybe with the slow
              patience of Jacob)
        - Look for your invitation in the mail from the people for whom
          it's going well! 
    - When things are just the way they are — not especially good, not
      especially bad
        - to give 'first fruits' to God
        - to tell these stories to yourself and your children and one
          another
- As we go into a time of 'prayer and praise' for one another — maybe
  you can reflect on how this story is touching you in your life.
