		<ul>
			<li>The irony of being a 'restorational' vs 'reformational' church

				<ul>
					<li>Church at Galatia, Church at Thessonika, "Super-apostles" at Corinth</li>

					<li>The apostles no better: The overly ambitious brothers (and their loving mother) Matt.20.20-Matt.20.28

						<ul>
							<li>James and John, the sons of Zebedee</li>

							<li>James martyred by Herod Agrippa I (Acts 12:1-2)</li>

							<li>John ?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Three Baptisms

				<ul>
					<li>By water, by John in the Jordan Luke 3

						<ul>
							<li>and so they were</li>

							<li>We believe that the baptism of believers with water is a sign of their cleansing from sin. Baptism is also a pledge before the church of their covenant with God to walk in the way of Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit. Believers are baptized into Christ and his body by the Spirit, water, and blood.

								<ul>
									<li>We baptize believers only</li>

									<li>With water, in the tradition</li>

									<li>As a sign of the cleansing</li>

									<li>As a pledge to God</li>

									<li>Baptized into Jesus</li>

									<li>Baptized by the Spirit, water, blood</li>
								</ul>
							</li>

							<li>Baptism by water is a sign that a person has repented, received forgiveness, renounced evil, and died to sin, [1] through the grace of God in Christ Jesus. Thus cleansed, believers are incorporated into Christ's body on earth, the church. Baptism by water is also a pledge to serve Christ and to minister as a member of his body according to the gifts given to each one. Jesus himself requested water baptism at the beginning of his ministry and sent his followers to "make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." [2] Baptism is done in obedience to Jesus' command and as a public commitment to identify with Jesus Christ, not only in his baptism by water, but in his life in the Spirit and in his death in suffering love.

								<ul>
									<li>Baptism by water

										<ul>
											<li>Sign of repentance, forgiveness thru Jesus</li>

											<li>Sign of cleansing and fit for the body</li>

											<li>Sign of a pledge to be a follower</li>

											<li>Done in obedience to Jesus's command, and by his example</li>

											<li>Done to further identify with him</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>By spirit, the dove and the word

						<ul>
							<li>and so they were, pentecost</li>

							<li>Luke 4 -- right after temptation, beginning of ministry"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,

								<p>because he has anointed me</p>

								<p>to proclaim good news to the poor.</p>

								<p>He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives</p>

								<p>and recovering of sight to the blind,</p>

								<p>to set at liberty those who are oppressed,</p>

								<p>19to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor."</p>
							</li>

							<li>Baptism is a testimony to God's gift of the Holy Spirit and the continuing work of the Spirit in the lives of believers. Through the Spirit we repent and turn toward God in faith. The baptism of the Holy Spirit enables believers to walk in newness of life, to live in community with Christ and the church, to offer Christ's healing and forgiveness to those in need, to witness boldly to the good news of Christ, and to hope in the sharing of Christ's future glory.

								<ul>
									<li>Spirit baptism

										<ul>
											<li>"Sign" that God gave us the Spirit</li>

											<li>"Sign" that God is at work, of our repentence</li>

											<li>enables us to be different

												<ul>
													<li>'newness of life'</li>

													<li>in fellowship with Jesus &amp; the church</li>

													<li>to help others</li>

													<li>to witness to the gosple</li>

													<li>to have hope</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>By blood, his death

						<ul>
							<li>martyrdom and exile</li>

							<li>The baptism of blood, or baptism of suffering, is the offering of one's life, even to death. Jesus understood the giving of his life through the shedding of his blood for others as a baptism. [3] He also spoke about his disciples' suffering and death as a baptism. [4] Those who accept water baptism commit themselves to follow Jesus in giving their lives for others, in loving their enemies, and in renouncing violence, even when it means their own suffering or death.

								<ul>
									<li>Baptism of blood

										<ul>
											<li>We offer our lives, unto death</li>

											<li>We offer our lives in example of Jesus</li>

											<li>We live to even love enemies and not do violence</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Christian baptism is for those who confess their sins, repent, accept Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, and commit themselves to follow Christ in obedience as members of his body, both giving and receiving care and counsel in the church. Baptism is for those who are of the age of accountability and who freely request baptism on the basis of their response to Jesus Christ in faith.

				<ul>
					<li>Who should be baptized?

						<ul>
							<li>Those who confess, repent, accept Jesus as Savior and Lord</li>

							<li>Those who seek to join the church</li>

							<li>Those who are old enough, and freely request it on these terms</li>
						</ul>
