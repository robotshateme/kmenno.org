Chapter VII: Meter

1. Poetic *meter* is the pattern of accented (symbol /) and unaccented (symbol -) syllables. The fundamental unit is the *foot*. The common feet are the *iamb*, *trochee*, *anapest*, and *dactyl*.

iamb = -/   trochee = /-   anapest = --/   dactyl = /--

2. The titles in the Sacred Harp are for tunes or pieces of music. Each tune is suited to a particular poetic meter. A metrical designation, printed next to the title, gives the meter of the appropriate poetry. Any poetry with this meter can sung as a tune is not restricted to the poetry printed with it.

3. One type of *metrical designation* gives the number of syllables in each line and number of lines in a stanza (verse). Thus 9898 denotes a four-line stanza with nine and eight syllables per line, alternating. In addition, some standard meters are named.

*common meter*, *C.M.*: iambic 8,6,8,6
*common meter double*, *C.M.D.*: iambic 8,6,8,6,8,6,8,6
*long meter*, *L.M.*: iambic 8,8,8,8
*long meter double*, *L.M.D.*: iambic 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8
*short meter*, *S.M*: iambic 6,6,8,6
*short meter double*, *S.M.D.* iambic 6,6,8,6,6,6,8,6
*common particular meter*, *C.P.M*: iambic 8,8,6,8,8,6
*long particular meter*, *L.P.M*: iambic 8,8,8,8,8,8
*meter hallellujah*, *H.M.*: iambic 6,6,6,6,8,8
*common meter hallellujah*, *C.H.M*: iambic 8,8,6,8,8,6
*meter 12s*, *M.T*, or *12,12,12,12*: anapestic 12,12,12,12
*meter 8s and 7s*: trochaic 8,7,8,7
*meter 11s*: anapestic 11,11,11,11
*meter 7s*: trochaic 7,7,7,7

4. *Paticular meter*, *P.M*, denotes poetry with its own peculiar meter, that is, not one of the standard meters. A hymn in a particular meter requires a special tune for that meter.

The poetic meter and the musical accent can be somewhat in conflict, and this can create interesting effects (sometimes good, sometimes bad, I think).

For a good example, Panting for Heaven (384) is listed as being as "8s" -- a named meter, but not named in the rudiments. It is 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8 (eight eights). The tune 2 over 4, which fits 8s easily enough. But, here's the thing -- if you read the poetry, you'll notice that it is:

oh WHEN will the PER-iod ap-PEAR
when I shall u-NITE in your SONG
i'm WEAR-y of LING-er-ing HERE
and I to your SAV-ior be-LONG.

i'm FET-tered and CHAINED up in CLAY,
i STUG-gle and PANT to be FREE:
i LONG to be SOAR-ing a WAY
my GOD and my SAV-ior to SEE.

That is, an iamb plus two anapests. Perhaps it could be called "acephalous (headless) anapestic trimeter". 

2/4 time has its primary musical accent on the first note. If we mark the syllables musically accented (just according to the time) with asterisks, we have:

"oh" "WHEN" will "the" PER-"iod" ap-"PEAR"
"when" I "shall" u-NITE "in" your "SONG"
"i'm" WEAR-"y" of "LING"-er-ing "HERE"
"and" "I" to your "SAV"-ior be-"LONG".

i'm "FET"-tered "and" CHAINED "up" in "CLAY",
"i" "STUG"-gle and "PANT" to be "FREE":
"i" "LONG" to be "SOAR"-ing a "WAY"
"my" "GOD" and my "SAV"-ior to "SEE".

I think this interesting jangle among metrical accent (including the 2/3/3 pattern of reaching 8 syllables, instead of having feet even in count) and musical accent ads a long of interest to this song. And the altos, too, of course :)

By the way, the other songs in the Denson book with meter 8s are in 6/4 time: Lovely Story (104), Edgefield (82b), Green Fields (127). (Christian Song (240) starts in 6/4 but changes mode of time and doesn't follow the poetry exactly). Singing the poetry of Panting for Heaven to Green Fields will show how much more 'natural' 6/4 is to this meter.
