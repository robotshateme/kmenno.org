Advent, as you probably know, means “arrival” or “coming.”It’s a time when we are expecting the arrival, the coming, the advent of a newthing, a new age. Of course, because Christmas is now just a few weeks away,our attention is drawn to the arrival of the baby Jesus; or, perhaps morehonestly, to the arrival of Christmas meals and celebrations and presents. Butin our time of worship, it’s likely that we will be focused on the story of thecoming of the Christ child: Jesus’s first advent.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>But you will of course notice that our Scriptures today donot speak of the coming of the Christ child. Well, perhaps we can find it inthe Isaiah passage: “O that you would tear open the heavens and come down!” Asin Christina Rossetti’s poem:</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Love came down at Christmas,</p><p class=MsoNormal>Love all lovely, love divine—</p><p class=MsoNormal>Love was born at Christmas;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Star and angels gave the sign.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Well perhaps. Reread that scripture: “O that you would tearopen the heavens and come down, so that the mountains would quake at yourpresences as when fire kindles brushwood and the first causes water to boil.”The events of Christmas do start the world boiling over with change and chaos:The loud singing of the angels, the flight to Egypt and murder of the innocentchildren. It’s not what we usually think of, though: we like to think, as inRossetti’s delightful poem, lovely thoughts in Advent.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>But the passage in Mark’s gospel is darker and more inconcert with Isaiah’s vision of earthquakes and fire:</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>But in those days, after that suffering,</p><p class=MsoNormal>The sun will be darkened,</p><p class=MsoNormal>And the moon will not give its light.</p><p class=MsoNormal>The stars will be falling from heaven,</p><p class=MsoNormal>And the powers in heaven will be shaken.</p><p class=MsoNormal>Then, they will see “the Son of Man coming in clouds” withgreat power and glory.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>This is a passage about Jesus’s “Second Advent,” Jesus’sSecond Coming. The heavens tear open, he appears in the sky with all of hisangels, and gathers up his followers from every place and time. It’s the end ofthe world. </p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>The season of Advent is about as much about this secondcoming as it is about the first. And about this second advent Jesus is veryclear what he wants us to do. And, as followers of Jesus, we pay closeattention to what he tells us to do, and try, with Spirit’s help, to practicethat. </p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>What does he tell us to do? He tells us four times, in threedifferent ways in my translation:</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list .5in'>(1)<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beware; that is, beaware (v. 33)</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list .5in'>(2)<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Keep alert. (v 33)</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list .5in'>(3)<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Keep awake. (v. 35)</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list .5in'>(4)<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Keep awake. (v. 37)</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>As Americans living in the age of the “Left Behind” books,we may be tempted to think of this watchfulness as “discerning the signs,”trying to understand what the creation of the state of Israel means, and theEuropean Union, and so on. I know this occupied a fair amount of my time as anolder teen-ager. But the passage is clear that the signs of his coming will beunmistakable and unambiguous. When the European Union expands or contracts, the“Left Behinders” have to jigger their theories about the ten-horned beast ofthe Revelation. But when Jesus comes in glory gathering his elect—this signwill be as clear as it was unpredictable: “about that day or hour no one knows,not the angels in heaven, not the Son, but only the Father.” Frankly, if Jesusdidn’t know when he was to return, I don’t expect to be able to guess the dateof his return. Certainly every Christian group that has predicted his imminentreturn have been wrong so far. The best guess of when Jesus will come again isduring a time when no one is expecting his return. One might say that a reasonJesus hasn’t yet returned is that people keep predicting his return, and theFather will have none of that. Perhaps the best way to open up the possibilityof his return is to stop predicting it.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>So, “Watchfulness,” which Jesus enjoins on us again andagain in this passage doesn’t mean matching up socio-political events to fitsome theory of how the last days will play out. But what does it mean?</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>“It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves homeand puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands thedoorkeeper to be on the watch. Therefore, keep awake, for you do not know whenthe master of the house will come: in the evening, or at midnight, or atcockcrow, or at dawn.” (v. 34-35)</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>This passage, and others like it (such as the parable of thetalents and the ten virgins we looked at briefly a couple of weeks ago) enjoinus to be about our work, and our work, as was Jesus’ work, is to do the will ofthe Father. Whatever God has given you to do, do it with all of your might. The job of the doorkeeper in the parable is to look for God to appear.Similarly, our job is to look out for where God is at work, and then our job isto do that work with God. </p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>There have been times and seasons in my life when I havefelt more aware and awake about what God is about. I must confess that thesedays I don’t feel it so much; I feel a certain lethargy in my spiritual life.And I need something or someone to wake me up; I need to wake myself up. It’sbeen difficult writing this teaching just because I want to encourage people tobe watchful, to be looking out for the work of God, but I’m not sure I actuallywant to do it myself. Jesus isn’t very fond of hypocrites, so, well, it’s nothard to understand my reluctance. </p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>So, “watchful” means</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list .5in'>(1)<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>having an increasedawareness of how God is active in my life and in the lives of others</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list .5in'>(2)<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“watching out” so thatthe work we are doing is likely to be less ashamed about what we’re doing withJesus does come “in the clouds.”</p><p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;tab-stops:list .5in'>(3)<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mantaining anawareness that he might arrive at any time, about his actual return, so when hecomes it is not a surprise.</p><p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoNormal>Whole religions have been founded around the idea of beingaware, of being “mindful.” And, I suppose we could found a little Christianmovement around this idea (the Lord’s Supper would have an important place inthis movement). And I want, at this time to open this time up for a discussion andsharing ideas of what practices we engage in that keep us awake and aware ofthe work of God. Perhaps this is just me asking the question: what can I do toget myself out of my spiritual lethargy? So, let’s talk: what keeps youwatchful?</p></div></body></html>
