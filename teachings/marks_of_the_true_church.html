<p>Romans 12:9-21 <br>
Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship <br>
September 20, 2009 <br>
Will Fitzgerald</p>

<p>[it was communion today, so in lieu of a sermon, I did this instead.]</p>

<p>Are you ready for a 22-point sermon?</p>

<p>First, notice that this list is &#8220;bookmarked&#8221; with love and goodness on
the one hand, and evil on the other. In verse 9: On the one hand,
&#8220;hate what is evil;&#8221; in verse 21: &#8220;Do not be overcome with evil.&#8221;  One
the other hand: &#8220;let love be genuine &#8230; hold fast to what is good,
love one another&#8221;. In verse 21: &#8220;Overcome evil with good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Second, that expression, &#8220;head burning coals on their heads.&#8221; Let&#8217;s
just agree that this won&#8217;t be the major focus of what we look at
today. Paul&#8217;s quote here is meant to encourage us to be kind to our
enemies and do them good. Maybe that will lead them to repentance or
to &#8220;kill them with kindness.&#8221; Basically, I don&#8217;t think anyone
understands the actual origins of this expression.</p>

<p>Third, these are the marks not of the true Christian, but the true
Christian <em>church</em>. The commands are given to &#8220;one another;&#8221; all of
the command verbs are plural. These are commands we are to obey
&#8220;jointly and severally,&#8221; that is, we are each of us liable to obey
these commands, but we are also liable to obey them <em>as a church,</em> and
to help one another obey them.</p>

<p>Fourth, because we are jointly and severally to obey these commands,
let&#8217;s look at them together. As I read the command, I would like you
to comment on:</p>

<ul>
<li>what the command means</li>
<li>ways that you&#8217;ve seen your brothers and sisters follow this command</li>
<li>ways you&#8217;ve seen what the <em>failure</em> to keep a particular command leads to</li>
<li>what it means for you personally</li>
<li>what it means for us as the Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship</li>
</ul>

<p>Ok! Let&#8217;s start.</p>

<ol>
<li>Let love be genuine; Hate what is evil, hold fast to what is good;</li>
<li>Love one another with mutual affection;</li>
<li>Outdo one another in showing honor.</li>
<li>Do not lag in zeal,</li>
<li>Be ardent in spirit,</li>
<li>Serve the Lord.</li>
<li>Rejoice in hope,</li>
<li>Be patient in suffering,</li>
<li>Persevere in prayer.</li>
<li>Contribute to the needs of the saints;</li>
<li>Extend hospitality to strangers.</li>
<li>Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.</li>
<li>Rejoice with those who rejoice,</li>
<li>Weep with those who weep.</li>
<li>Live in harmony with one another;</li>
<li>Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly;​ [lowly things or
lowly people]</li>
<li>Do not claim to be wiser than you are.</li>
<li>Do not repay anyone evil for evil,</li>
<li>But take thought for what is noble in the sight of all.</li>
<li>If it is possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.</li>
<li>Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave room for the wrath of
God;​for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the
Lord.” No, “if your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are
thirsty, give them something to drink; for by doing this you will heap
burning coals on their heads.”</li>
<li>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</li>
</ol>
