The God who hurts and heals

Hosea 6:1-3
> “Come, let us return to the Lord; 
> for it is he who has torn, and he will heal us; 
> he has struck down, and he will bind us up. 
> 2 After two days he will revive us; 
> on the third day he will raise us up, 
> that we may live before him. 
> 3 Let us know, let us press on to know the Lord; 
> his appearing is as sure as the dawn; 
> he will come to us like the showers, 
> like the spring rains that water the earth.” 

This passage has been on my mind recently:
- James Herron preached on it at the Ministerial Alliance two weeks ago
- It was a daily reading passage in the lectionary I've been using
- Time line from Journey, Dan Miller's comment about the hard times often being times of growth

The Message:

> “Come on, let’s go back to God. 
>  He hurt us, but he’ll heal us. 
>  He hit us hard, 
>  but he’ll put us right again. 
>  In a couple of days we’ll feel better. 
>  By the third day he’ll have made us brand-new, 
>  Alive and on our feet, 
>  fit to face him. 
>  We’re ready to study God, 
>  eager for God-knowledge. 
>  As sure as dawn breaks, 
>  so sure is his daily arrival. 
>  He comes as rain comes, 
>  as spring rain refreshing the ground.”     
 
God is a healer, but God is also present in the times we are hurt; It is not incorrect even to say that God is the one who hurts us; for God's care for us extends to every part of our life.

This particular message sees to be about repentance and healing 
- "let us return to the Lord", 
- Hosea's general message is about repentance.

But also, let us look at Hosea's life
- Gomer, his wife is unfaithful, a prostitute
  - perhaps he knew this ahead of time, perhaps not
  - three children
    - Jezreel (sounds like Isreel - a bloody place of battle)
    - Unpitied (not Hosea's?)
    - Alien (not Hosea's?)

- This is, of course, a metaphor for God and Israel, which God calls Hosea to act out

- God hurts Hosea -- to say nothing of Gomer and their children 
- God uses this hurt as a message of warning and healing to Israel
- The children receive new names
  - Jezreel now means 'God sows'
  - Unpitied becomes 'Pitied'
  - Alien becomes 'My People'

- Surgeons hurt for a greater healing.
- Parents deny things for a greater good.
- Musicians practice hard for a 'payoff' later.

I wonder, then, how we can reflect on the hurts in our own present and our own past and ask,

- How has God been part of them?
- In what way has God used these for our greater healing?
- What ways should we stop our self-hurting?
