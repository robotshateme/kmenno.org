Isaiah 2:1-5, Psalm 122, Romans 13:11-14, Matthew 24:36-44

This week Bess told me that our neighbors noticed some people have been evidentially casing the houses in our neighborhood, and we should probably be more vigilant. When we left to go to the Ann Arbor area on Thursday for Thanksgiving dinner with her sister, I put my work computer in a somewhat hidden place. I guess I was hoping they might find Bess's computer first? I'm really not very good at this.

I guess I am always aware that there is a possibility that someone will break into our house. We live pretty close to the areas in Kalamazoo with the largest number of break-ins. When we lived on Douglas, we had several incidents, including a spike tossed through our window. Oddly, just being on the other side of Main Street seems to make a difference.

Jesus's teaching in Matthew 24:36-44 asks us to consider what it would mean for God to be the one who is breaking in:

> "Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour."

As I think I have said before, it's a very odd thing to be asked to expect the unexpected.

In San Francisco, at least in the Mission, the part of the city where I have usually stayed when I'm there, people have a tradition of putting unwanted items out on the sidewalk. I remember my friend Rick coming home one day excited to have found a toaster that was better than the toaster we used. I don't know what he did with the old toaster, actually.

But you could put stuff out, and expect that someone would come by and take it. It's not stealing if you leave it out for people to take, I think.

Nadia Bolz-Weber is a Lutheran pastor in Denver, and I have been listening to the audio version of her book _Accidential Saints_. Bolz-Weber is very big on grace, and my mind has been turning over and over thinking about what she says about God's grace, and the grace we are called to have for one another.

In fact, Bolz-Weber discusses this very teaching of Jesus's in her book.

"How can you be ready for something you don't know is coming," she asks. And her answer is: "We can't."

In fact, she makes the audacious claim that just maybe Christ is coming to rob us of all the stuff that we don't need.

"Perhaps,", she says, "during Advent, a season with pornographic levels of consumption in which our credit card debts and our waistbands expand, the idea that Jesus wants to break in and jack some of our stuff is really good news."

She even suggests that perhaps we should make Advent lists of things we want Jesus to take away. Maybe that's material things (like Rick's unneeded toaster). But maybe it's our "self-loathing or resentment ... compulsive eating or our love of money." I'm sure we could all add things to this list, our secret and our not-so-secret lists of shame and guilt, the burden of memory, the broken relationships.

Where is the grace in all of this?

Grace in its most basic sense is the unanticipated, undeserved gift of God's love for us. God wants our good. God wants our good. God wants our good when we mess up. God wants our good when others have messed up, and left us in bad places. God wants others' good, when we were the ones who messed them up, our children, family, friends, business partners.

God is powerful, and God bends the universe in favor of those whom God loves. Of course, this is all very complicated, and I can't begin to understand it very well. But at least one thing is clear to me: how this happens is going to happen in very unexpected ways, ways I can't really anticipate.

So, I will "do the work" I need to do. I'll see a therapist, get the sleep I need, say my prayers, gather with God's people.

And yet, when I look back on the changes in myself--the good changes, I mean--many of them have come in unexpected, unanticipated ways.

- Adopting and raising children, which I think I thought was going to be hard, but was so much harder than I ever imagined.
- Marrying Bess out of "true love," and finding out that forging a life together requires buckets and buckets of grace towards one another.
- Getting into a really interesting and meaningful career, and finally learning that it wasn't all that important after all.
- Going off to join a Christian commune, and learning that grace is perhaps even more important when you're trying to be just the right kind of dedicated Christian.

I am aware of some of the burdens and difficulties that many of you are carrying. I don't know what your work is. But keep doing it. But also, I encourage you to expect the unexpected, to watch for the ways your friends and children and even your enemies will end up being means of grace to you. Perhaps that is by stealing away some of the dreams and plans you had for yourself, or by stealing away some of your pettiness or anger or shame or guilt. "The Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour." Expect the unexpected.
