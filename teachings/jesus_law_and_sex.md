Mt 5:27-30 Concerning Adultery
Mt 5:31-32 Concerning Divorce

5:27 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 28 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart. 29 If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.​l​ 30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.​m​
Concerning Divorce
(Mt 19.9; Mk 10.11—12; Lk 16.18)
31 “It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ 32 But I say to you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

Last time I taught on Matthew 5:17-20, where Jesus talks about his relationship to the law of Moses. Jesus insists that, in order for us to enter his kingdom, we must be even better than the best person you can think of, you must fulfill every part of the Law in order to be great. 

It's a kind of riddle, I think:

> What is better than good? What is more lawful than the Law? 

Deciphering this riddle is crucial; Jesus even seems to think our life depends on it.

Jesus goes on to talk about specific moral areas, some of which we have discussed. He talks about anger, about oaths, about retaliation and love, about about almsgiving. And in the passage we are looking at today, he talks about sexuality and marriage. These are deep waters, but let's wade in. 

In some ways, Jesus riddle is clearer in his statements about adultery than in any of the other parts of the Sermon on the Mount. God thought that adultery was such a terrible thing, that it made the list of top ten commandments. God takes adultery very seriously, and so does Jesus.

But Jesus takes it even further. It's not just adultery that he condemns. He says when a man looks at a woman with lust, it's as if he has committed adultery with her already. And, by analogy, the same is true for a woman looking at a man with lust, or a man looking at another man with lust, or a woman looking at another woman with lust. If you're married and are thinking of another man or woman, If you're single, and thinking of anyone in this way. All of these are equally bad, and all of these are as bad as adultery.

I want everyone to close their eyes, and I'm going to close my eyes, too. And I want everyone here who has ever broken this rule of Jesus's once to raise their hands. How about at least five times? 

Ok, you can open your eyes now. I think I have a pretty good idea of how many people raised their hands.

We are sexual beings, and God has given us the good gifts of sex, and sexual attraction to all normally developed people. But all good things are apt to be converted to bad ends. And all of us have converted our sexual desires to bad ends. This is the simple definition of "lust."

> What is better than good? What is more lawful than the law?

Jesus tells a scary riddle next, and he suggests a simple method to prevent our falling into lust: simply cut out your eyes, and you won't look with lust on another person; Simply cut off your limbs, and you won't really be thinking about sex. It's likely that Jesus has set of members in mind here, too. Cutting those off just might guarantee we won't have bad sex. We'll have to remove large parts of our brains and nervous systems, too, the parts that control sexual desire. Once we've blinded ourselves, cut off our limbs and other members, and the sex parts of our brains, we'll be safe.

Oh, or maybe Jesus is just asking his riddle again:

> What is better than good? What is more lawful than the law?

Jesus goes on to talk about one thing our bad sexual desire can lead us, a common enough and sordid enough tale. Something like this: A married man sees another woman and wants her, enough to divorce his wife, something which was perfectly legal under the law of Moses, just as it is perfectly legal today. His first wife remarries.

Not only does Jesus say that this man is committing adultery, but something even harder: _his_ bad decisions results in the brokenness of adultery for his former wife: her marriage is adultery too. We are all adulterers, and our adultery causes others to commit further adulteries.

> What is better than good? What is more lawful than the law?

Later in his ministry, Jesus was asked a series of riddles himself: should people pay taxes, what is the status of a marriage after death, and, importantly, for our discussion this morning, what the greatest commandment was. This riddle and its answer is found in Matthew 22:34-40

> Matthew 22:34 When the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together, 35 and one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. 36 “Teacher, which commandment in the law is the greatest?” 37 He said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the greatest and first commandment. 39 And a second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” 

So, Jesus's answer to his own riddle seems to be: Love is better than good, and Love is more lawful than the law. As the gospel of John says, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life."  We were not good enough to _deserve_ God's love; rather, we are bad enough to _need_ God's love.

What does that mean for our lives as sexual beings? Does this mean we love anyone we want, in a sexual or romantic way? Or engage in any lustful behavior or justify breaking our marriage vows?

Of course not. Jesus gives us an ideal that breaks us down so we know that we need his love, but the ideal is not there just to break us; God's desire for us is that we are pure in heart sexually. I was talking to my friend Rick this week about this passage, and he reminded me that having ideals like these remind us to practice becoming more attuned to our ideals, not to become good enough to merit God's favor (which Jesus patently says we cannot), but because it is good for us, it is what we are made to do.

Simply put, when we journey towards a live in which we love our spouse, and only our spouse; or live chastely in singleness that we expect will not change, or live chastely in anticipation of a godly marriage, our lives become better and better. When we journey towards sexually promiscuity, or constantly think about getting out of our marriages, or feel bitter at our unmarried state, our lives will become worse and worse. Of course, it's not a one-way road that, once we start on, we inevitably go down. It is likely that we will have a lot of variance in our behavior. 

But we keep Jesus as our goal, and look at Love as guide that maps our discipleship out. We ask ourselves questions such as, Does this relationship make me a better follower of Jesus? Does it make my beloved the same? How can I love my wife, my husband, my boyfriend, my girlfriend better? 

What do you think? Does Love solve the Riddle of how to be better than good?
