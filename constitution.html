        The constitution of the Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship
      </h1>
      <p>
        (Draft of December 29, 2008; Amended January 3, 2010)
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Name.</em> The name of this organization is “Kalamazoo Mennonite Fellowship”.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Mission.</em> Our mission is to be a fellowship of faithful disciples of Jesus Christ, “for no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 3:11).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Affiliation.</em> We are affiliated with the Mennonite Church USA, within the Indiana-Michigan Mennonite Conference. We accept the Confession of Faith in a Mennonite Perspective (1995) as our basic statement of belief and practice.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Members.</em> We have two kinds of members: regular members and associate members.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regular membership is extended to those who:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Trust in Jesus Christ for their salvation,
            </li>
            <li>Commit to follow the teachings and example of Jesus Christ,
            </li>
            <li>Have received a Christian baptism,
            </li>
            <li>Commit to active participation in the life of the Fellowship.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If someone seeking membership is currently a member of another Christian church, it is normally expected that the person’s church provide a letter of transfer. Exceptions can be approved by the Council. Membership must be approved by the Council.
          </p>
          <p>
            Associate Membership is extended to any who prefer an associate status, and whose desire for association is approved by the Council.
          </p>
          <p>
            The membership of persons who persist in flagrant disobedience to the teachings and example of Jesus Christ may be removed by the the Council by at least a two-thirds majority vote. The membership of persons who persist in inactive participation may be removed by the Council by a simple majority vote.
          </p>
          <p>
            All members are entitled to participate in the active life of the Fellowship. Regular members who are at least 16 years of age are eligible to vote on all questions at Meetings for Business. Regular members who are at least 18 years of age are eligible to be members of the Council.
